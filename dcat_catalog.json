            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1.\tCollect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2.\tAnalyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3.\tProvide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Baerwaldt, Crystal; Torres, Francheska; Niemela, Amanda; Vance, Lisa. 2025-12-11.

            "description": " Dissolved oxygen levels in the Stockton Deep Water Ship Chanel (SDWSC) have been monitored since 1968 by the Interagency Ecological Program's (IEP) Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). The SDWSC is located on the San Joaquin River near Stockton, California. Beginning in 1997, 14 stations were routinely monitored typically in summer and fall. Dissolved oxygen impairment can occur in the SDWSC; therefore, two water quality objectives were established. The objectives of the dissolved oxygen monitoring study in the SDWSC are to: (1) determine if dissolved oxygen levels comply with the water quality objectives, (2) monitor long term trends, and (3) detect and document changes along the SDWSC. The EMP collects discrete dissolved oxygen readings near the surface and bottom of the water column during ebb slack tide. The 14 stations are located between Prisoner's Point on the San Joaquin River and ends at the terminus of the channel called Turning Basin. The site locations were selected at the channel markers on the San Joaquin River; therefore, may be referred as station number or channel marker they are located at. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature were recorded 1-meter below surface and 1-meter above the bottom of the channel. Over the period of record the following water quality parameters have been added: water temperature, specific conductance, pH, fluorescence, turbidity, secchi disk and a rating score for the blue-green algae, Microcystis aeruginosa\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Lesmeister, Sarah; Rinde, Jenna. 2020-09-02.

            "description": " Condition 8 of the June 2021 Temporary Urgency Change Order for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) requires a special study of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta (Delta) and the spread of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), and floating aquatic vegetation (FAV), also referred to as \u201caquatic weeds\u201d. A report on the study was submitted to the State Water Resources Control Board on June 1, 2022. This data package contains all publicly available data used in the report, including visual cyanobacteria reports, cyanotoxin data, water quality, nutrients, flow/hydrodynamics, chlorophyll-a concentrations, temperature, coverage of SAV and FAV, use of herbicides, and human populations. Many of these data were derived from other datasets, though some were collected specifically for this study\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Rasmussen, Nicholas; Flynn, Theodore; Bouma-Gregson, Keith; Khanna, Shruti; Frantzich, Jared; Battey, Morgan; Perry, Sarah; Bashevkin, Samuel; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Perry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany; Klotz, Vivian; Khanna, Shruti; Ustin, Susan; Lay, Mui; Andrew, Margaret; Santos, Maria; Hestir, Erin; Shapiro, Kristen; Bellvert, Joaquim; Greenberg, Jonathan; Khanna, Shruti; Ustin, Susan; Bashevkin, Samuel; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth. 2023-05-03.

The raw YBFMP\u2019s water temperature data was collected by loggers\n      attached to the rotary screw trap (STTD) and Sherwood Harbor (SHR). Logger data ranged from\n      daily means (1998) to a fifteen-minute collection interval (2013-2017 for the Yolo Bypass,\n      2009-2019 for Sherwood Harbor). A daily mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and\n      coefficient of variation in water temperature was produced as well as columns for sample size\n      (n, number of measurements per day), method (data collection or estimation), category, length\n      (number of consecutive missing dates) and site. Daily water temperature data for the full\n      extent of the YBFMP\u2019s fish collection is valuable for a variety of purposes. For example,\n      variation in water temperature during inundation and comparisons between temperatures in the\n      Sacramento River and Yolo Bypass have been used as metrics of habitat complexity and linked to\n      life history diversity in salmon (Goertler et al. 2017).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoertler, Pascale ; Pien, Catarina; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Hamilton, Jasmine; Hartman, Rosemary; Nelson, Michelle; Saraceno, JohnFranco; Schreier, Brian; Davis, Brittany; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Kwan, Nicole. 2022-07-27.

            "description": " The upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE) is simultaneously a central\n    hub of water delivery in California and home to commercially\n    important and endangered fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, Green\n    Sturgeon, and Delta and Longfin Smelt. Extensive ecological\n    monitoring has been conducted for over 50 years, mainly under the\n    auspices of the Interagency Ecological Program for the San Francisco\n    Estuary (https://iep.ca.gov/). We integrated water quality data from\n    16 boat-based long-term monitoring surveys in the upper SFE. This\n    integrated dataset includes measurements of temperature (surface and\n    bottom), conductivity (surface), salinity (surface), Secchi depth,\n    qualitative concentration of the toxic alga Microcystis\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Battey, Morgan; Perry, Sarah; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); McKenzie, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Nanninga, Adam; Cook, John; Hagen, Jackie; Mahardja, Brian; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Senegal, Taylor; Mckenzie, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Perales, Brynn; Bridgman, David; Erly, Kate; Staiger, Stephen; Arrambide, Adriana; Gilbert, Morgan; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Lesmeister, Sarah; Rinde, Jenna; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Kwan, Nicole; Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Damon, Lauren; Temple, Trishelle; Chorazyczewski, Adam; J, Cloern; T, Schraga; T, Schraga; E, Nejad; C, Martin; J, Cloern; CDFW; CDFW; CDFW; Teejay, O'Rear; John, Durand; Peter, Moyle; USBR; R, Dahlgren; L, Loken; E, Van Nieuwenhuyse; U.S. Geological Survey; CDWR. 2023-06-08.

            "description": " In summer 2018 we used a unique water control structure in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) to direct a managed flow pulse into Suisun Marsh, one of the largest contiguous tidal marshes on the west coast of the United States.  The action was designed to increase habitat suitability for the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a small osmerid fish endemic to the upper SFE.  The approach was to operate the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) in conjunction with increased Sacramento River tributary inflow to direct an estimated 160 x 10^6 m3 pulse of low salinity water into Suisun Marsh during August, a critical time period for juvenile Delta Smelt rearing. This dataset includes physical and biological monitoring data collected for the action. Datasets include Delta Smelt catch from the USFWS Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program, zooplankton and Microcystis abundance from the Environmental Monitoring Program, historic Delta Smelt catch from the Summer Townet Survey, Delta Outflow from the Dayflow model, extent of Delta Smelt habitat from the UnTRIM Bay-Delta model, and water quality (Salinity, Temperature, Chlorophyll, and Turibidity) collected at continuous sondes at three locations. These data are associated with the manuscript \"Evaluation of a large-scale flow manipulation to the upper San Francisco Estuary: Response of habitat conditions for an endangered native fish,\" by Dr. Ted Sommer, et al. 2020 PLOS One, in review.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Sommer, Ted; Koohafkan, Michael; Burdi, Christina; Bever, Aaron; MacWilliams, Michael; Galef, Jeff; Barros, Arthur; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Johnston, Catherine; Lee, Sunny; Mahardja, Brian; Speegle, Jonathan; Barnard, Denise; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen. 2020-07-30.

The objectives of the EMP are to obtain consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring stations, provide and document information necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards, and to report this information for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary. While the EMP also collects biological data, this dataset only includes the discrete water quality and nutrient data collected by the EMP from 1975-2021.

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are presented in this dataset. The rotary screw trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine species abundance and life stage of juvenile outmigrants and resident small-bodied fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, and (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns. The fyke trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine abundance of migrating and resident adult fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, especially with regard to anadromous species, (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns, and (4) provide data on the timing and duration of species captured in the Yolo Bypass for comparison to those captured in other Sacramento Valley tributaries. The beach seine surveys are conducted in the Yolo Bypass\u2019s perennial channel (Toe Drain), inundated floodplain, disconnected inundated ponds, and perennial ponds. The objectives of Toe Drain and inundated floodplain beach seine sampling are: (1) to examine species abundance and composition in different water year types and inundation conditions, (2) to spatially compare fish abundance and diversity in the Yolo Bypass, and (3) to estimate growth rates and densities of salmon in the Yolo Bypass versus the Sacramento River. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. Key findings include: (1) YB is a major factor regulating year class strength of splittail (Sommer et al. 1997; Feyrer et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2007a); (2) YB is a key migration corridor for adult fish of several listed species and sport fish (Harrell and Sommer 2003; Johnston et al. 2020); (3) YB is one of the most important regional rearing areas for juvenile Chinook salmon (Sommer et al. 2001a; 2005; Goertler et al. 2017, 2018; Sommer et al. 2020); (4) YB provides habitat for endangered Delta Smelt and its congeners (Mahardja et al. 2019; Davis et al. 2022), (5) and YB is a source of phytoplankton to the food web of the San Francisco Estuary (Jassby and Cloern 2000; Schemel et al. 2003; Sommer et al. 2004a; Frantzich et al. 2018).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa; Kwan, Nicole. 2025-04-08.

            "description": " The Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) have the potential to increase low-salinity-zone habitat for endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus, California Endangered Species Act listed as Endangered, Federal Endangered Species Act listed as Threatened), and to allow them to more frequently occupy Suisun Marsh, especially Montezuma Slough, one of their most important rearing habitats. Operation of the SMSCG in summer and fall to improve Delta Smelt habitat are called for in the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take permit for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. To support the adaptive management of the action, the California Department of Water Resources and collaborating agencies monitored water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, clams, and fishes during the SMSCG management actions in 2018. Monitoring has continued during the summer and fall months of all subsequent years, including both those with and without actions. This data package includes data collected by the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) long-term monitoring programs supplemented with targeted sample collection where existing surveys lacked spatial or temporal coverage. Monitoring during no-action years will be used as a baseline for comparison during action years. This data package will be updated annually.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Rasmussen, Nick; Burdi, Christina; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Wells, Elizabeth; Stewart, Alan; Battey, Morgan; Nelson, Michelle; Tran, Andrew; Neumayr, Stephen; Perry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany; Klotz, Vivian; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Erly, Kate; Cook, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Bigham, Gershom; Supervisory Fish Biologist, Denise, Barnard; Senegal, Taylor. 2026-01-14.

            "description": " The Department of Water Resources (DWR) North Central Region Office (NCRO) Water Quality Evaluation Section (WQES) and the Division of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) provide technical expertise and program support for regulatory compliance, water operations, emergency response, and environmental restoration. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are large overgrowths of algae in eutrophic marine or freshwater ecosystems that degrade beneficial uses of water resources, from aesthetics to habitat quality to human consumption. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta has observed an increasing number of HABs, especially in the South Delta. These HABs have been composed primarily of cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (BGA). The most prevalent HAB producing cyanobacteria in recent years is the freshwater species Microcystis aeruginosa - a known producer of toxins called microcystins. Microcystins negatively affect the health of aquatic and terrestrial organisms alike, including humans and their pets. In late 2017, the Central Valley Water Resources Control Board (CVWRCB) issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification for the DWR South Delta Temporary Barriers Projects. This certification required DWR to develop a dataset of surface Microcystis Visual Index (MVI) values during standard water quality station visits. In addition to the MVI, requirements for DWR to collect water samples for phytoplankton enumeration and cyanotoxin analysis began in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Together these data help DWR and CVWRCB to understand the distribution and composition of the algal community in the South Delta and to evaluate the species that contribute to HABs.  As a separate project, DWR O&M collects cyanotoxin and taste and odor samples at Clifton Court Forebay and the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant to ensure that the water exported from the Delta is safe for use. This dataset provides an ongoing collection of taste and odor and cyanotoxin analysis beginning in 2009 and 2012, respectively.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFrantzich, Jared; Rosenow, Brooke. 2025-09-18.

In addition to mercury, DWR collected organic carbon, total suspended sediment, chlorophyll-a, temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, turbidity, total chlorophyll, velocity, level, and flow data. To do this, three sets of data were collected: 1) velocity, level, and flow data were collected continuously using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, 2) continuous temperature, specific conductance, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and total chlorophyll were collected using a water quality sonde, and 3) THg, MeHg, organic carbon, total suspended sediment, and chlorophyll-a were collected via grab samples either by sampling pole or flow-weighted composites with an autosampler.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLee, Petra; Manning, Julianna. 2020-07-16.

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fisheries and invertebrate monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass since 1998. The main objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to collect baseline data on lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and insect drift), juvenile and adult fish, hydrology, and water quality parameters. As the Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by numerous regulatory agencies, these baseline data are critical for evaluating success of future restoration projects. In addition, the data have already served to increase our understanding of the role of the Yolo Bypass in the life history of native fishes, and its ecological function in the San Francisco Estuary. Zooplankton are an important component in the diet of larval, juvenile, and small adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, Striped Bass, and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects zooplankton year-round from two sites. Since 2011, samples have been collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using 150- and 50- micrometer mesh plankton nets. Zooplankton are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently BSA Environmental Services). The goals of the zooplankton monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variation in species densities and trends between (1) the Sacramento River channel, and (2) the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Data on zooplankton catch and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole. 2021-12-09.

            "description": " The Continuous Environmental Monitoring Program (CEMP) plays an instrumental role in overseeing real-time water quality in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) and Suisun Bay. The program harnesses wireless telemetry to transmit crucial data to the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), making high-resolution environmental data pertaining to the Delta and Suisun Bay publicly accessible. The extensive dataset captures information at 15-minute intervals from 15 monitoring stations, utilizing YSI 6600 and YSI EXO sondes to obtain standalone water quality measurements.  This extensive dataset informs the operations of the California State Water Project, ensuring it adheres to mandated water quality standards set by Water Right Decision 1641. This data compilation incorporates all information since the transition to YSI multiparameter sondes in 2005. It is important to note that the commencement dates and subsequent upgrades vary between stations, leading to slight discrepancies in the dataset's date ranges.  Since its inception in the mid-1980s, CEMP has progressively expanded its monitoring capabilities, consistently augmenting the number of monitoring locations and the array of water quality parameters assessed. Its commitment to utilizing the most advanced water quality monitoring technology reaffirms its position as an environmental monitoring leader in the Delta and Suisun Bay. Today, the program oversees 15 water quality stations that reliably capture data every 15 minutes, each day of the year, transmitting this data in real-time.  The core tenents of CEMP: \u2022 to obtain consistent and accurate data in real-time at established monitoring stations \u2022 to provide data necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards \u2022 to perform data analyses for further understanding of estuarine ecology \u2022 to report information to other government agencies, as well as the public, for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE). \u2022 to provide continuous water quality monitoring expertise for other groups within DWR and sister agencies for the benefit of ecological studies throughout the San Francisco- Sacramento Estuary\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nNelson, Michelle; Tran, Andrew. 2025-04-22.

            "title": "Monitoring juvenile Chinook salmon outmigration using rotary screw traps on the Sacramento River at Knights Landing",
            "description": " Since 1995, the rotary screw traps (RSTs) at Knights Landing have\n    provided water management agencies an early warning of emigrating\n    juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead\n    trout (O. mykiss) making their way to the Sacramento-San Joaquin\n    Delta (Delta). Due to the proximity of the site to other major\n    tributaries of the Sacramento River, such as the Feather and\n    American Rivers, it is assumed that salmonids captured at the\n    Knights Landing RSTs originate from the upper Sacramento River and\n    its tributaries, a stretch of river that provides spawning and\n    rearing habitat for all four runs of natural origin Chinook salmon:\n    winter-run (State and federally listed as endangered), spring-run\n    (State and federally listed as threatened), late fall-run and\n    fall-run, as well as steelhead trout (federally listed as\n    threatened). The near real-time information RST monitoring data provides on\n    emigration timing and relative abundance for protected runs of\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead improves the ability for\n    resource agencies and water managers to implement protective\n    measures that help them navigate through the maze of waterways in\n    the Delta. By utilizing emigration data in adaptive management,\n    reservoir releases, export rates, water transfers, and Delta Cross\n    Channel Gate operations can be modified to minimize the risk of\n    predation, entrainment, and take, thereby maximizing juvenile\n    salmonid survival through the Delta. The primary goals of the Knights Landing Monitoring Program are to\n    (1) Provide early warning of listed salmonids emigrating toward the\n    Delta, (2) Document passage of emigrating salmonids including\n    timing, relative abundance, and environmental conditions, (3)\n    Develop passage estimates of salmonids emigrating through the lower\n    Sacramento River above the Delta, and (4) Develop a long-term\n    dataset on juvenile salmonid emigration to compare changes over\n    time. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) issued ITP\n    2081-2019-066-00 to DWR on March 31, 2020, for the long-term\n    operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the Delta. Condition\n    7.5.2 of the ITP requires the development and establishment of a\n    spring-run Chinook salmon juvenile production estimate (JPE) to\n    increase understanding of the impacts water operations have on the\n    spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. Data from the Knights Landing RST will be used along\n    with other datasets from juvenile salmonid monitoring programs in\n    the Sacramento River Watershed to inform the development of JPE\n    modeling approaches. Salmonid data collected from the Knights Landing RST, among other\n    datasets, is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to\n    understand the movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed to estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon that have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time\n    operations monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2\n    of the ITP which meets weekly from October through June, to provide\n    advice for real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and\n    the Water Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBauer, Nick. 2025-12-03.

            "description": " The Cache Slough Complex is an ecologically significant area, with many restoration efforts of various kinds set to take place within its boundaries. These efforts which are tied to regulations set forth by the Biological Opinion, will have unknown impacts to in\u2010stream water quality. For this reason, the Department of Water Resources\u2019 Water Quality Assessment (WQA) unit developed a monitoring program to establish baseline water quality measurements to help understand the environmental impact of these restoration projects and ensure pre\u2010restoration water quality data is available to compare against post-restoration water quality. To do so, data was collected at various sites that represent all major inputs and outflows within the Cache Slough Complex from September 2013 to December 2021.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nDel Cid, Jeremy; Brown, Travis. 2024-08-07.

The objective of this data collection effort is to\n    determine the relative abundance and distribution of rearing\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead. A secondary objective is to\n    collect baseline data for future monitoring programs associated with\n    habitat restoration projects. Crews survey units within 20 sampling\n    sections on the high flow (HFC) and low flow channel (LFC) between\n    January and September and collect information on species, fish size,\n    substrate, cover, and habitat type. This dataset represents an\n    extensive time series that could be used to identify habitat\n    conditions where juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead occur and how\n    these conditions have changed over time. These data were published\n    to support the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCampos, Casey. 2024-09-27.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

In-lake monitoring (in-situ measurements) is needed to understand better the processes contributing to poor water quality. This data package contains the in-situ measurements collected by the University of California, Davis at Clear Lake between 2019 and 2023, which include: continous stream properties at three locations (Middle, Scott, and Kelsey Creeks); continuous meteorological variables at seven locations around the perimeter of the lake; continuous lake temperature and dissolved oxygen at multiple depths and locations across the lake (six permanent water quality stations); continuous lake surface temperature in the shoreline; and discreate samples to measure nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biovolumes and species identification throughout the water column and across all three lake basins every 6-8 weeks.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCort\u00e9s, Alicia; Schladow, Samuel; Forrest, Alexander; Sadro, Steven. 2025-06-27.

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Fish catch and associated water quality for the Fall Midwater Trawl Survey, Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 1967-2024",
            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Fall Midwater Trawl Survey (FMWT) is a long-term monitoring survey conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and has sampled annually since its inception in 1967, with the exceptions of 1974 and 1979, when sampling was not conducted. The FMWT was initiated to determine the relative abundance and distribution of age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) in the San Francisco Estuary (California, United States), but the data has also been used for other upper estuary pelagic species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), American Shad (Alosa sapidissima), Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), and Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense). The FMWT currently samples 130 stations each month from September to December and a subset of this data is used to calculate an annual abundance index. These 130 stations range from San Pablo Bay upstream to Stockton on the San Joaquin River, and West Sacramento on the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. FMWT sampling data includes 193 unique station locations throughout the San Francisco Estuary; 63 are not currently sampled.  Most stations no longer sampled occur in South and Central San Francisco Bay (1968-1979), with others located in San Pablo Bay and upstream into the Delta. There are catch records for stations that were sampled only once. Data users are encouraged to look at station frequency over time to understand when and where sampling occurred. Sampling takes approximately 14 days per month to complete. Historically, FMWT sampling occasionally began as early as July (1972) or August (1968-1973, 1993-1994, 1996-1997) and sometimes continued past December to March (1968-1973, 1978, 1991-2001) or beyond (1992-1995). The Spring Midwater Trawl (SMWT) was a modified survey created to continue sampling January-March to track movements of mature adult delta smelt from 1991-2001. SMWT was replaced in 2002 with the more effective Spring Kodiak Trawl (SKT). All fish, shrimp, and jellyfish are identified and enumerated. In addition, the crew measures water temperature (\u00b0C), specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm), Secchi depth, and Turbidity (NTU). FMWT also currently collects meso- (copepods and cladocerans) and macro- (mysids and amphipods) zooplankton samples at 35 stations. Midwater and zooplankton tows conducted by FMWT allow for determination of available zooplankton prey resources. FMWT equipment and methods have remained consistent since the survey's inception, which allows annual abundance indices to be compared across time. Monthly and annual abundance indices are calculated using catch data from 100 \u201cindex\u201d stations grouped into 14 regional \u201careas\u201d. Monthly indices are calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for all 14 areas. Annual abundance indices are the sum of the 4 (September-December) monthly indices.  The FMWT catch data has been used to meet permit obligations to the State Water Resources Control Board (SW and DRCB) via Water Rights Decisions (D-1485 and D-1641) and USFWS-NMFS biological opinions for Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), and for incidental take permits issued by CDFW for operation of Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP).

Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Board's Water Right Decision D-1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For over five decades, this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distributional patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting changes in community composition. The Zooplankton Study uses three gear types to sample macro-, meso-, and micro-zooplankton across the upper SFE on a monthly basis.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nShaw, Caroline. 2025-06-20.

            "description": " Projected temperature increases due to global climate change are\n  likely to have localized impacts on the San Francisco Estuary (SFE).\n  Increased water temperature in the SFE will lead to challenges for\n  managing water resources. Many native species, such as salmon and\n  smelt, rely on cooler water, and will be further stressed by increased\n  water temperature. While real-time water temperature is collected by\n  several state and federal agencies in the San Francisco Estuary, a\n  landscape-scale synthesis of available water temperature data has not\n  been conducted for the SFE. For this dataset, we compiled continuous\n  water temperature data and associated metadata from the SFE to\n  generate an integrated and usable dataset of known quality for climate\n  and ecological analysis. Data were obtained from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC;\n  https://cdec.water.ca.gov/) for consistency (data are untreated) and\n  efficiency (existing code to download data directly from CDEC). Data\n  were integrated and standardized to hourly water temperature data in\n  degrees Celsius. A series of quality control (QC) checks were then\n  applied in a consistent manner to all stations. Datasets included in\n  this package include raw hourly data, flagged data, and filtered data\n  (where flagged data are removed). Additionally, information regarding\n  current and historical sensors used for water temperature data\n  collection was obtained from station managers for each station, and\n  compiled in a metadata table.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Hamilton, Jasmine; Hartman, Rosemary; Nelson, Michelle; Saraceno, JohnFranco; Schreier, Brian; Davis, Brittany; Department of Water Resources. 2020-08-23.

            "description": " The objective of our study is to better understand the factors affecting chlorophyll-a production within a floodplain and its transport downstream to determine how lateral connectivity influences longitudinal connectivity.  The Yolo Bypass is an engineered floodplain of the Sacramento River that inundates during periods of high outflow via overtopping weirs. Water traveling through the Yolo Bypass flows parallel to the Sacramento River and re-connects to the mainstem at the southern extent of the floodplain. Several monitoring programs in the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta and Yolo Bypass collect discrete and continuous water quality data, including chlorophyll measurements. For this study, we synthesized available flow, water temperature, chlorophyll and inundation data between March 1999 to December 2019 and modeled the effects of environmental variables and inundation on chlorophyll-a production in the floodplain, the mainstem, and downstream of the floodplain/mainstem.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPien, Catarina; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Goertler, Pascale; Peek, Ryan; Chapple, Dylan; Yamane, Lauren; Berglund, Mattea; Khanna, Shruti; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Adams, Jesse; Pien, Catarina; Goertler, Pascale ; Pien, Catarina; Goertler, Pascale ; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Ruhl, Catherine; Cheng, Robin. 2023-12-13.

            "description": " The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. DATA CORRECTION/UPDATE: Previous data versions 244.6, 244.7, and 244.8 contained an error and resulted in duplicated records of hatchery Chinook Salmon in the datasets. These datasets were removed from the data repository and the error was corrected in version 244.9 and after.

            "description": " Within the San Francisco Estuary, beach seining has been used since the 1970s by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) to monitor the relative abundance and distribution of juvenile Chinook salmon and other fishes of management concern occurring in near shore habitats. Over 2,000 seine samples are currently being collected throughout the San Francisco Estuary annually. Data from these surveys are used to make various water operation decisions and help inform managers on the status of fish populations within the San Francisco Estuary. By not accounting for the variability of species- and size-specific efficiency of beach seines across environmental gradients, the metrics developed by the DJFMP are likely underestimated and biased to an unknown extent. Consequently, the ability of the DJFMP to document the true occupancy of fishes for water operations and population vicissitude may be inhibited. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to estimate the species- and size-specific capture efficiency of DJFMP beach seines for fishes occurring in near shore habitats within the San Francisco Estuary. The second objective is to model the observed efficiency estimates using habitat variables to allow managers to account for incomplete detection when estimating fish abundance and occupancy from DJFMP beach seine data.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service; Kirsch, Joseph; Marshall, Mike; Johnston, Catherine; Arrambide, Adriana; Speegle, Jonathan. 2025-10-09.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Summer Townet Survey (STN) is a long-term effort to monitor the annual recruitment success of young pelagic fishes in the upper San Francisco Estuary (California, United States). Conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) since 1959, STN has sampled fixed locations from Eastern San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista on the Sacramento River, and to Stockton on the San Joaquin River; and a single station in the lower Napa River. The study area was expanded in 2011 to include the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (SDWSC) and Cache Slough (CS). Currently, 40 stations are sampled as a \u201csurvey\u201d every other week June through August for 6 surveys. A conical net, lashed to a fixed metal \u201cD\u201d frame, is pulled obliquely through the water column 2 to 3 times at each station. All fish and macro-invertebrates are identified and enumerated from each tow, with fork lengths (mm) of the first 50 of each fish species also recorded. Fish catch, length-frequency, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) among stations is available with data visualization tools on the study website for all species (https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey). Data collected at historic 31 stations are used to calculate annual relative abundance indices for age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The remaining 9 stations are sampled to expand our sampling range further upriver and increase our understanding of larval and juvenile fish abundance and distribution in the lower Napa River and the North Delta. A meso-zooplankton net targeting copepods and cladocerans is also used in parallel to assess fish food resources at each station and a subset of the fish collected are retained for diet analysis by CDFW researchers (beginning 2005, see STN and FMWT zooplankton data on EDI). The STN also measures habitat conditions via water temperature (\u00b0C), water clarity (Secchi disk depth in cm), Turbidity (NTU) and specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm). Historically, STN began in response to the development of Central Valley Project pumping plants exporting water from the South Delta. STN continues to monitor fish abundance and distribution in relation to water diversions, for the operation of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, and management flow actions to improve summer-fall habitat conditions. Managers and researchers use the data collected by STN to inform decisions and improve our understanding of the health of the upper San Francisco Estuary.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nJohnson, Margaret; Rohlin, Taylor; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Ugbah, Nene; Rocha, Allegra; Slater, Steven; Malinich, Timothy; White, James; Burdi, Christina. 2025-10-08.
