            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1.\tCollect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2.\tAnalyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3.\tProvide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Baerwaldt, Crystal; Torres, Francheska; Niemela, Amanda; Vance, Lisa. 2025-12-11.

            "description": " Dissolved oxygen levels in the Stockton Deep Water Ship Chanel (SDWSC) have been monitored since 1968 by the Interagency Ecological Program's (IEP) Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). The SDWSC is located on the San Joaquin River near Stockton, California. Beginning in 1997, 14 stations were routinely monitored typically in summer and fall. Dissolved oxygen impairment can occur in the SDWSC; therefore, two water quality objectives were established. The objectives of the dissolved oxygen monitoring study in the SDWSC are to: (1) determine if dissolved oxygen levels comply with the water quality objectives, (2) monitor long term trends, and (3) detect and document changes along the SDWSC. The EMP collects discrete dissolved oxygen readings near the surface and bottom of the water column during ebb slack tide. The 14 stations are located between Prisoner's Point on the San Joaquin River and ends at the terminus of the channel called Turning Basin. The site locations were selected at the channel markers on the San Joaquin River; therefore, may be referred as station number or channel marker they are located at. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature were recorded 1-meter below surface and 1-meter above the bottom of the channel. Over the period of record the following water quality parameters have been added: water temperature, specific conductance, pH, fluorescence, turbidity, secchi disk and a rating score for the blue-green algae, Microcystis aeruginosa\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Lesmeister, Sarah; Rinde, Jenna. 2020-09-02.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is difficult to visually distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to genetic lineage; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program compliance monitoring programs. The genetic lineage was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines. Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Drift invertebrate and ichthyoplankton catch and water quality from the Sacramento River channel, and Sacramento River floodplain and tidal slough, collected by the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program, 1998-2022",
            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. Aquatic and terrestrial insects are an important component in the diet of juvenile and adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including two important native fishes: juvenile Chinook Salmon and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects drift invertebrates year-round from two sites. Currently, samples are collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using a rectangular aquatic drift net that sits at the surface of the water. Invertebrates are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc.). The goals of the monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends of aquatic and terrestrial insects/non-insects within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Drift invertebrate Key findings to date include: (1) Chinook Salmon sampled in the floodplain had diets comprised of 90% Dipterans and zooplankton, with Chironomidae being the dominant Diptera family (Sommer et al., 2001), (2) The floodplain of the Yolo Bypass contains significantly higher densities of Diptera (Diptera densities being positively associated with flow) and terrestrial invertebrates than the adjacent Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2001b: Sommer et al. 2004: Sommer et al. 2007), (3) A major portion of the diet of juvenile Sacramento Splittail are chironomid larvae (Kurth and Nobriga 2001, Moyle et al. 2004, Sommer et al. 2007), and (4) The Yolo Bypass was the site of the discovery of a new aestivating and winter emerging chironomid; Hydrobaenus saetheri (Cranston et al. 2007). The collection of ichthyoplankton is one of multiple elements of the YBFMP. Currently, the YBFMP collects ichthyoplankton in the Yolo Bypass from January to July. Historically, ichthyoplankton were also sampled in the Sacramento River, but due to low catch, this was stopped in 2019. Sampling is conducted with a 500-micron mesh conical plankton net. Fish are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc). The initial goal of ichthyoplankton monitoring was to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain (Sommer et al. 2003). The collection of ichthyoplankton samples is an important element in determining the annual presence, timing, and recruitment success of fishes utilizing the Yolo Bypass. Data on ichthyoplankton and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset. Key findings to date include: (1) 26 species of fish larvae were observed in the Yolo Bypass during the 20-years of monitoring (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data), including Delta Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus (Sommer et al 2004); (2) The native Prickly Sculpin and non-native Threadfin Shad dominated samples, contributing to over 60% of the total larval catch (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (3) Native species made up a higher percent of total catch in the Yolo Bypass (22.43%) in comparison to in the Sacramento River (10.2%), and appeared earlier in the year than many non-natives (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (4) Similar to other seasonal floodplains in the San Francisco Estuary, alien fishes made up a large portion of the assemblage of early life stages in the Yolo Bypass (Sommer et al 2004); (5) Water temperature and stage are the best explanatory environmental variables for larval fish abundance in the Yolo Bypass (p=0.001). Flow was not statistically significant (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (6) Species richness and diversity are higher in the Yolo bypass in comparison to in the Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2004).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa. 2024-12-11.

            "description": " In summer 2018 we used a unique water control structure in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) to direct a managed flow pulse into Suisun Marsh, one of the largest contiguous tidal marshes on the west coast of the United States.  The action was designed to increase habitat suitability for the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a small osmerid fish endemic to the upper SFE.  The approach was to operate the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) in conjunction with increased Sacramento River tributary inflow to direct an estimated 160 x 10^6 m3 pulse of low salinity water into Suisun Marsh during August, a critical time period for juvenile Delta Smelt rearing. This dataset includes physical and biological monitoring data collected for the action. Datasets include Delta Smelt catch from the USFWS Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program, zooplankton and Microcystis abundance from the Environmental Monitoring Program, historic Delta Smelt catch from the Summer Townet Survey, Delta Outflow from the Dayflow model, extent of Delta Smelt habitat from the UnTRIM Bay-Delta model, and water quality (Salinity, Temperature, Chlorophyll, and Turibidity) collected at continuous sondes at three locations. These data are associated with the manuscript \"Evaluation of a large-scale flow manipulation to the upper San Francisco Estuary: Response of habitat conditions for an endangered native fish,\" by Dr. Ted Sommer, et al. 2020 PLOS One, in review.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Sommer, Ted; Koohafkan, Michael; Burdi, Christina; Bever, Aaron; MacWilliams, Michael; Galef, Jeff; Barros, Arthur; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Johnston, Catherine; Lee, Sunny; Mahardja, Brian; Speegle, Jonathan; Barnard, Denise; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen. 2020-07-30.

            "description": " The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) sets water quality objectives to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Bay. These objectives are met by establishing standards mandated in water right permits issued to the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation by the SWRCB. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels. In 1971, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This Decision contained new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. D-1379 was also the first water right decision to provide terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to routinely determine water quality conditions and changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. The monitoring program described in D-1379 was developed by the Stanford Research Institute through a contract with the SWRCB. Implementation of the monitoring program began in 1972, as SWRCB, DWR, and USBR met to define their individual responsibilities for various elements of the monitoring program. In 1978, amendments to water quality standards were implemented and resulted in Water Right Decision 1485 (D-1485). More recently these standards were again amended under the 1995 Water Quality Control Plan and Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) established in 1999. The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements described in D-1641. D-1641 requires DWR and USBR to conduct a comprehensive environmental monitoring program to determine compliance with the water quality standards and also to submit an annual report to SWRCB discussing data collected. The phytoplankton monitoring program is one element of DWR\u2019s and USBR\u2019s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton, and benthic organisms. The overall objective of the phytoplankton monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in phytoplankton diversity, abundance, and distribution associated with physical and other biological factors in the estuary.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are presented in this dataset. The rotary screw trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine species abundance and life stage of juvenile outmigrants and resident small-bodied fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, and (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns. The fyke trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine abundance of migrating and resident adult fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, especially with regard to anadromous species, (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns, and (4) provide data on the timing and duration of species captured in the Yolo Bypass for comparison to those captured in other Sacramento Valley tributaries. The beach seine surveys are conducted in the Yolo Bypass\u2019s perennial channel (Toe Drain), inundated floodplain, disconnected inundated ponds, and perennial ponds. The objectives of Toe Drain and inundated floodplain beach seine sampling are: (1) to examine species abundance and composition in different water year types and inundation conditions, (2) to spatially compare fish abundance and diversity in the Yolo Bypass, and (3) to estimate growth rates and densities of salmon in the Yolo Bypass versus the Sacramento River. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. Key findings include: (1) YB is a major factor regulating year class strength of splittail (Sommer et al. 1997; Feyrer et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2007a); (2) YB is a key migration corridor for adult fish of several listed species and sport fish (Harrell and Sommer 2003; Johnston et al. 2020); (3) YB is one of the most important regional rearing areas for juvenile Chinook salmon (Sommer et al. 2001a; 2005; Goertler et al. 2017, 2018; Sommer et al. 2020); (4) YB provides habitat for endangered Delta Smelt and its congeners (Mahardja et al. 2019; Davis et al. 2022), (5) and YB is a source of phytoplankton to the food web of the San Francisco Estuary (Jassby and Cloern 2000; Schemel et al. 2003; Sommer et al. 2004a; Frantzich et al. 2018).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa; Kwan, Nicole. 2025-04-08.

            "description": " To manage the critically low 2021 water supply for beneficial uses, DWR installed the temporary emergency drought barrier (EDB) on West False River in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta (Delta), approximately 5 miles south of Rio Vista, California, in Contra Costa County in June 2021. To monitor the effectiveness and impacts of the EBD, a monitoring program was initiated to track changes in hydrodynamics, water quality, fish, harmful algal blooms, and aquatic weeds in the vicinity of the EDB. The EDB was left in place during the winter of 2021-2022 and removed in fall of 2022. This data set includes all data collected as part of that monitoring program and subsets of ongoing monitoring programs that were used in the final effectiveness report for the EDB.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Huston, David; Frantzich, Jared; Salman, Tyler; Ateljevich, Eli; Clark, Kevin; Bergman, Paul; Klambach, Andrew; Wilder, Rick; Silva, Matthew; Hassrick, Jason; Hinkelman, Travis; Spaulding, Taylor; Slater, Steven; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; McKenzie, Ryan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Stagg, Jacob; Hagen, Jackie; Huber, Eric; Steinhart, Geoffrey; Arrambide, Adriana; Siddiqui, Samreen; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina. 2024-06-04. 2021-2022 West False River Emergency Drought Barrier water quality, flow, and fish monitoring ver 2.

Wireless telemetry is used to transmit real-time provisional data to the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), making the data publicly available. The published dataset is quality controlled and quality assured providing detailed information at 15-minute intervals from 18 monitoring stations, using Xylem\u2019s YSI EXO2 and YSI 6600 multiparameter sondes to document individual water quality measurements of multiple water quality parameters. The dataset informs operations for the California State Water Project and supports water quality monitoring required by Water Right Decision D-1641, the Delta Compliance Program, the South Delta Temporary Barriers and the South Delta Improvement Program. It is important to note that the start dates and subsequent equipment upgrades vary between stations and equipment leading to discrepancies in the dataset\u2019s date ranges.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFrantzich, Jared; Huynh, Elena. 2025-10-08.

            "description": " The Department of Water Resources (DWR) North Central Region Office (NCRO) Water Quality Evaluation Section (WQES) and the Division of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) provide technical expertise and program support for regulatory compliance, water operations, emergency response, and environmental restoration. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are large overgrowths of algae in eutrophic marine or freshwater ecosystems that degrade beneficial uses of water resources, from aesthetics to habitat quality to human consumption. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta has observed an increasing number of HABs, especially in the South Delta. These HABs have been composed primarily of cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (BGA). The most prevalent HAB producing cyanobacteria in recent years is the freshwater species Microcystis aeruginosa - a known producer of toxins called microcystins. Microcystins negatively affect the health of aquatic and terrestrial organisms alike, including humans and their pets. In late 2017, the Central Valley Water Resources Control Board (CVWRCB) issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification for the DWR South Delta Temporary Barriers Projects. This certification required DWR to develop a dataset of surface Microcystis Visual Index (MVI) values during standard water quality station visits. In addition to the MVI, requirements for DWR to collect water samples for phytoplankton enumeration and cyanotoxin analysis began in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Together these data help DWR and CVWRCB to understand the distribution and composition of the algal community in the South Delta and to evaluate the species that contribute to HABs.  As a separate project, DWR O&M collects cyanotoxin and taste and odor samples at Clifton Court Forebay and the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant to ensure that the water exported from the Delta is safe for use. This dataset provides an ongoing collection of taste and odor and cyanotoxin analysis beginning in 2009 and 2012, respectively.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFrantzich, Jared; Rosenow, Brooke. 2025-09-18.

RST operations were conducted by CDFW and then under the\n    direction of the Yuba River Management Team from 1999 to 2009 at the\n    Hallwood Boulevard site; and resumed in 2022 by DWR. The Hallwood\n    site will essentially sample all areas of the lower Yuba River\n    upstream of Hallwood Boulevard. Additionally, the Hallwood site is\n    located downstream of the bulk of adult Chinook salmon spawning\n    areas and downstream of all known spring-run Chinook salmon\n    spawning. Data are currently being used to inform the development of\n    a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring-run Chinook salmon\n    in the Sacramento River Watershed as required by Incidental Take\n    Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 issued by CA Department of Fish and\n    Wildlife (CDFW) to DWR for the long-term operation of the State\n    Water Project.

            "description": " The Tisdale RST sampling site is operated by the California\n    Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to obtain information on the\n    temporal distribution, relative abundance, and composition of race\n    and species of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)\n    and steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the upper Sacramento\n    River and tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta).\n    The project collects data near the Tisdale Weir on the Sacramento\n    River, using two paired rotary screw traps (RSTs) outfitted with two\n    8-ft diameter cones. The RST monitoring site at Tisdale Weir was established meet a\n    requirement of the 2011 amendment to the reasonable and prudent\n    alternative (RPA) of the 2009 biological and conference opinion (BO)\n    on the long-term operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and\n    State Water Project (SWP). The amendment required the Bureau of\n    Reclamation (USBR) and the California Department of Water Resources\n    (DWR) to fund a new juvenile salmonid monitoring site on the\n    Sacramento River between Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD) and Knights\n    Landing. The purpose of the new site was to provide early warning of\n    fish movement and determine survival of listed fish species leaving\n    spawning habitat in the upper Sacramento River. CDFW issued ITP 2081-2019-066-00 to DWR on March 31, 2020, for the\n    long-term operation of the SWP in the Delta. Condition 7.5.2 of the\n    ITP requires the development and establishment of a spring-run\n    Chinook salmon juvenile production estimate (JPE) to increase\n    understanding regarding the impacts water operations have on the\n    spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. Data from the Tisdale RST will be used along with other\n    datasets from juvenile salmonid monitoring programs in the\n    Sacramento River Watershed to inform the development of JPE modeling\n    approaches. Salmonid data collected from the Tisdale RST, among other datasets,\n    is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the\n    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to\n    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that\n    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring\n    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets\n    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time\n    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation\n    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHuneycutt, Andrew. 2025-03-01.

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fisheries and invertebrate monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass since 1998. The main objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to collect baseline data on lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and insect drift), juvenile and adult fish, hydrology, and water quality parameters. As the Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by numerous regulatory agencies, these baseline data are critical for evaluating success of future restoration projects. In addition, the data have already served to increase our understanding of the role of the Yolo Bypass in the life history of native fishes, and its ecological function in the San Francisco Estuary. Zooplankton are an important component in the diet of larval, juvenile, and small adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, Striped Bass, and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects zooplankton year-round from two sites. Since 2011, samples have been collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using 150- and 50- micrometer mesh plankton nets. Zooplankton are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently BSA Environmental Services). The goals of the zooplankton monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variation in species densities and trends between (1) the Sacramento River channel, and (2) the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Data on zooplankton catch and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole. 2021-12-09.

Monitoring is\n    conducted annually from October through June utilizing an 8-ft\n    diameter rotary screw trap (RST) and a diversion screen trap (DST).\n    Data from this monitoring is used to estimate juvenile spring-run\n    Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) abundance and passage,\n    identify alevin emergence timing, document juvenile size at\n    emigration, and document rearing and emigration patterns. This data\n    will also be used to inform the development of a juvenile production\n    estimate (JPE) for spring-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed as required by Condition of Approval 7.5.2 of Incidental\n    Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) issued by CDFW to California\n    Department of Water Resources (DWR) for the long-term operation of\n    the State Water Project. Salmonid data collected from the Butte\n    Creek RST, among other datasets, is also used by the Salmon\n    Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the movement of juvenile salmon\n    in the Sacramento River Watershed to estimate the number of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that have entered the\n    Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). SaMT is a real-time operations\n    monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP\n    which meets weekly from October through June, to provide advice for\n    real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water\n    Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and\n    spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta.

            "description": " California Department of Water Resources (DWR) currently operates\n    multiple eight-foot rotary screw traps (RSTs) in both the Low Flow\n    Channel (LFC) and High Flow Channel (HFC) of the upper 21.5 river\n    miles of the Lower Feather River. The LFC extends from the Fish\n    Barrier Dam at river mile (RM) 67.2 to the Thermalito Outlet (RM\n    59). The HFC extends from the Thermalito Outlet to the confluence\n    with the Sacramento River. This survey has been ongoing since 1997\n    with the objective of documenting general salmonid emigration\n    attributes, such as timing, abundance and composition of salmon and\n    investigating the influence of environmental factors thought to\n    initiate emigration, such as flow, turbidity and water temperature.\n    Data from this monitoring will also be used to inform the\n    development of a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed as required by\n    Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 issued by CA Department\n    of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to DWR for the long-term operation of\n    the State Water Project. Data within the current year\u2019s monitoring\n    season are considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nKindopp, Jason. 2026-01-30.

            "description": " The Cache Slough Complex is an ecologically significant area, with many restoration efforts of various kinds set to take place within its boundaries. These efforts which are tied to regulations set forth by the Biological Opinion, will have unknown impacts to in\u2010stream water quality. For this reason, the Department of Water Resources\u2019 Water Quality Assessment (WQA) unit developed a monitoring program to establish baseline water quality measurements to help understand the environmental impact of these restoration projects and ensure pre\u2010restoration water quality data is available to compare against post-restoration water quality. To do so, data was collected at various sites that represent all major inputs and outflows within the Cache Slough Complex from September 2013 to December 2021.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nDel Cid, Jeremy; Brown, Travis. 2024-08-07.

            "description": " CDFW issued Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) to the\n    California Department of Water Resources (DWR) on March 31, 2020,\n    for the long-term operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the\n    Sacramento San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Condition 7.5.2 of the ITP\n    requires the development and establishment of a spring-run Chinook\n    salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) juvenile production estimate (JPE)\n    to increase understanding of the impacts that water operations have\n    on the spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and to inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. As a part of the JPE effort, CDFW began operating a new rotary screw\n    trap (RST) monitoring station on the lower Feather River near River\n    Mile 17, approximately 1 mile downstream of Star Bend Park and Boat\n    Ramp near Olivehurst, in January 2022. This RST location represents\n    the lowest point in the Feather River Watershed where juvenile\n    salmon are sampled with an RST prior to entering the Sacramento\n    River and includes salmon emigrating from the Yuba River. The\n    expanded juvenile monitoring effort will help resource agencies and\n    water managers identify numbers of salmon emigrating from the\n    Feather River Watershed and contributing to the spring-run Chinook\n    salmon population entering the Delta. Monitoring is conducted annually from October through June utilizing\n    a pair of eight-foot rotary screw traps (RST). Data collected at the\n    Lower Feather River RST site provides information on the temporal\n    distribution, relative abundance, and race composition of juvenile\n    Chinook salmon; and temporal distribution and relative abundance of\n    steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the Feather River and\n    tributaries, including the Yuba River, to the Delta. Salmonid data\n    collected from the Lower Feather River RST, among other datasets, is\n    also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the\n    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to\n    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that\n    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring\n    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets\n    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time\n    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation\n    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLoera, Gabe. 2025-12-16.

            "description": " The Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s (Reclamation) Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California Department of Water Resource\u2019s (DWR) State Water Project (SWP) deliver millions of acre-feet of water annually for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and environmental needs in California from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta) through the C.W. \u201cBill\u201d Jones Pumping Plant (JPP) and Banks Pumping Plant.  Since 1957, a Reclamation operated fish salvage facility, the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF), is located upstream of the JPP and functions to salvage fish entrained in exported water (Bates and Vinsonhaler 1957).  Additionally, the John E. Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility (SDFPF) was added by the California Department of Water Resources in 1968 to salvage fishes diverted by the SWP.  The salvage process involves fish collection, counting, handling and transportation back to the Delta.  To prevent fish loss, CVP and SWP fish facilities were constructed at Old river, where fish are diverted to the fish facilities for counting and reporting.  After counting, the fish are collected in storage tanks and taken to several release locations in the Delta via fish-haul tank trucks.  Millions of fishes from 69 species are salvaged through this process by the two fish facilities.  Data collected includes species collected, fish lengths, water flow, export amounts, and water quality.  Fishes listed (Endangered Species Act (ESA) or California Endangered Species Act (CESA)) were Chinook Salmon, Delta Smelt, steelhead trout, Longfin Smelt, and Green Sturgeon.  The California Department of Fish and Wildlife monitors fish salvage and manages the data collected from the fish facilities in addition to data collected and managed by DWR and Reclamation.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAfentoulis, Virginia; Siddiqui, Samreen; Aasen, Geir; Griffiths, Walter; Malinich, Timothy; Damon, Lauren; Aasen, Geir; Aasen, Geir; Morinaka, Jerry; Reyes, Rene. 2025-07-11.

            "description": " Phytoplankton community composition is an important driver of zooplankton productivity and food supply for higher trophic levels in the San Francisco Estuary. Various monitoring surveys throughout the region collect phytoplankton enumeration data dating back to the 1990s. These include surveys from the CA Department of Water Resources (CADWR), CA Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and the US Geological Survey (USGS). These surveys collect data via various sampling and laboratory methods which are not always directly comparable. This integrated dataset includes both enumeration counts and well-documented metadata to allow for informed decision-making in the integration of these data. It also standardizes taxonomic names between groups via a key list. Note that, in this dataset, we make conservative decisions about taxonomic resolution to ensure maximum compatibility between groups. For more detailed metadata and higher taxonomic resolution, refer to individual surveys\u2019 publications or reach out to their primary contact.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPerry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany. 2025-11-13.

            "description": " The San Francisco Bay Study (Bay Study) was established in 1980 to determine the effects of freshwater outflow on the abundance and distribution of fish and mobile crustaceans (brachyuran crabs and caridean shrimp) in the San Francisco Estuary, mainly downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Bay Study survey currently samples 52 open-water stations monthly from a research vessel with two types of trawl gear: a midwater trawl to sample pelagic fishes, and an otter trawl to sample demersal fishes, crabs, and shrimp. Historically, the study also included plankton sampling (1980-1989) for larval fish and crustaceans. Fish collected by the otter and midwater trawl are identified to species, counted, and a representative subsample is measured. In addition, crabs from the otter trawl are identified, counted, sexed, and measured, and gelatinous zooplankton from the midwater trawl are identified and counted. Shrimp are retained from each otter trawl sample and returned to the laboratory for processing, which includes identification, counts, sex, and length. Additional data collected at each station includes water depth, Secchi, and a water column profile of temperature and conductivity. This data publication includes fish, crab, shrimp, gelatinous zooplankton (jellies), and water quality data. Metadata related to the plankton sampling will be included in the future when this data is published.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHieb, Kathryn; Burns, Jillian; Soto, Kenji. 2026-02-04.

Fishes are commonly\n  preserved in formalin; however, formalin preservation is associated\n  with reduced fish length and increased weight, but the magnitude and\n  timing of these changes may vary among species. Unaccounted for\n  preservation-driven shifts in fish length and weight may have drastic\n  effects on any conservation or ecological conclusions drawn from\n  specimen preserved for various durations as well as when compared to\n  fresh, unpreserved specimen. The \u200bpurpose of this study was to \u200btest\n  whether formalin fixation and preservation affects endangered Delta\n  Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSlater, Steven; Burdi, Christina; Gaeta, Jereme; Frick, Madeleine. 2020-08-31.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

Surveys are conducted bi-weekly, and sampling begins in December and continues through mid-March. The SLS samples at fixed stations, from San Pablo Bay through Suisun Bay and into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Napa River stations were added in 2014 and the San Pablo Bay expansion stations were added in December 2022. Each sampling week currently consists of 59 stations. At each station, one 10-minute stepped oblique (bottom to top) tow is conducted following a prescribed tow schedule. The net is a conical 500 \u00b5m mesh lashed to a D-shaped frame mounted on skis. Larval fish samples are preserved in the field in 10% formalin and brought back to the CDFW Stockton Lab for identification and enumeration under a microscope. Several types of data are collected at each station in addition to the larval fish sample, including the volume of water sampled by the net, surface water temperature, surface and bottom specific conductance (EC normalized at 25\u02daC), Secchi disk depth, tow duration, tidal condition, and surface water turbidity.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBrennan, Colin; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica. 2025-09-11.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "description": " Since 2014, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has\n    conducted annual Chinook salmon redd surveys. The objective of this\n    data collection effort is to quantify and understand potential shits\n    in redd distribution and potential habitat differences between\n    historic and restored sites. The redd surveys are conducted in the\n    uppermost 16 miles of the lower Feather River though have been\n    concentrated in the uppermost two miles of the lower Feather River\n    in, and adjacent to the Gravel Supplementation Areas (GSAs). Redd\n    surveys are conducted less frequently in the 14 miles downstream of\n    the GSAs. Surveys typically begin in mid-September at the onset of\n    spawning and generally conclude at the end of November. This dataset\n    represents an extensive time series that could be used to identify\n    habitat conditions where Chinook salmon spawn, how these conditions\n    have changed over time, especially in areas where restoration has\n    occurred. These data were published to support the Healthy Rivers\n    and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCook, Chris. 2025-03-06.

            "description": " The Fish Restoration Program Monitoring Team assesses the biological effectiveness of 8,000+ acres of tidal wetland restoration in the Upper San Francisco Estuary (Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh) through a contract with the CA Department of Water Resources. The restoration is pursuant to requirements in the 2008/2009 and 2019 Biological Opinions for state and federal water project operations. Data on fish and invertebrate abundance on or near these sites was collected as baseline monitoring data and to determine the most efficient methods for monitoring wetlands. Understanding how invertebrate, fish, and phytoplankton communities change pre- to post-restoration is essential to evaluating the benefits of tidal wetlands to native fish species. Invertebrate data was collected using sweep nets, benthic cores, neuston nets, and zooplankton trawls. Fish data was collected using otter trawls, lampara nets, and beach seines. For each method, the team recorded the catch of fish, invertebrates, and other organisms, length of selected organisms, and a suite of environmental information, including: dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, and dissolved organic carbon. Additional water quality samples, processed for Chlorophyll a, Dissolved Ammonia, Dissolved Nitrite + Nitrate, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Dissolved Organic Nitrogen, Dissolved Ortho-phosphate, Pheophytin a, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Total Organic Carbon, Total Phosphorus, and Total Suspended Solids, were collected at a subset of sampling sites. Data are collected before and after restoration at project and reference sites (Before-After-Control-Impact-design), as well as at adjacent water bodies.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBowles, Christy; Sherman, Stacy; Avila, Michelle; Cox, Daniel; Murray, Emma; Chavez, Amanda; Dungey, Darian; Ng, Gabriel; Hartman, Rosemary; Ellis, Daniel; Contreras, Dave. 2025-04-30.

Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Board's Water Right Decision D-1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For over five decades, this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distributional patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting changes in community composition. The Zooplankton Study uses three gear types to sample macro-, meso-, and micro-zooplankton across the upper SFE on a monthly basis.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nShaw, Caroline. 2025-06-20.

            "description": " The objective of this study was to assess the relative distributions\n  of non-native resident fishes occurring in littoral habitats during\n  the drought year of 2014 within the western and northern portion of\n  California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), USA. A number of\n  non-native resident fish species (e.g., black bass, Micropterus spp.)\n  in the Delta have undergone remarkable increases in density in the\n  early 2000s and they are potential predators of endangered native\n  fishes such as Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Delta\n  Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The Delta makes up the tidal\n  freshwater portion of the San Francisco Estuary in California;\n  however, the critically dry year of 2014 caused a considerable\n  intrusion of salinity field within this region and may have caused a\n  shift in the resident fish community. To evaluate the response of\n  non-native resident fishes to this salinity intrusion, a boat\n  electrofishing survey was conducted in November of 2014 in the western\n  and northern part of the Delta by the United States Fish and Wildlife\n  Service, Lodi, California Office as part of the Interagency Ecological\n  Program for the San Francisco Estuary. Replicate sampling was done for\n  each site in this study in order to account for false zeroes through\n  the estimation of capture probability.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; Kirsch, Joseph; Mahardja, Brian. 2019-10-23.

            "description": " The objective of our study is to better understand the factors affecting chlorophyll-a production within a floodplain and its transport downstream to determine how lateral connectivity influences longitudinal connectivity.  The Yolo Bypass is an engineered floodplain of the Sacramento River that inundates during periods of high outflow via overtopping weirs. Water traveling through the Yolo Bypass flows parallel to the Sacramento River and re-connects to the mainstem at the southern extent of the floodplain. Several monitoring programs in the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta and Yolo Bypass collect discrete and continuous water quality data, including chlorophyll measurements. For this study, we synthesized available flow, water temperature, chlorophyll and inundation data between March 1999 to December 2019 and modeled the effects of environmental variables and inundation on chlorophyll-a production in the floodplain, the mainstem, and downstream of the floodplain/mainstem.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPien, Catarina; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Goertler, Pascale; Peek, Ryan; Chapple, Dylan; Yamane, Lauren; Berglund, Mattea; Khanna, Shruti; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Adams, Jesse; Pien, Catarina; Goertler, Pascale ; Pien, Catarina; Goertler, Pascale ; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Ruhl, Catherine; Cheng, Robin. 2023-12-13.

            "description": " Drivers of phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics vary spatially and temporally in estuaries due to variation in hydrodynamic exchange and residence time, complicating efforts to understand controls on food web productivity. We conducted approximately monthly (2012 \u2013 2019; n = 74) longitudinal sampling at ten fixed stations along a freshwater tidal terminal channel in the San Francisco Estuary, California, characterized by seaward to landward gradients in water residence time, turbidity, nutrient concentrations, and plankton community composition. We used multivariate autoregressive state space (MARSS) models to quantify environmental (abiotic) and biotic controls on phytoplankton and mesozooplankton biomass. The importance of specific abiotic drivers (e.g. water temperature, turbidity, nutrients) and trophic interactions differed significantly among hydrodynamic exchange zones with different mean residence times. Abiotic drivers explained more variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics than a model including only trophic interactions, but individual phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions explained more variation than individual abiotic drivers. Interactions between zooplankton and phytoplankton were strongest in landward reaches with the longest residence times and the highest zooplankton biomass. Interactions between cryptophytes and both copepods and cladocerans were stronger than interactions between bacillariophytes (diatoms) and zooplankton taxa, despite contributing less biovolume in all but the most landward reaches. Our results demonstrate that trophic interactions and their relative strengths vary in a hydrodynamic context, contributing to food web heterogeneity within estuaries at spatial scales smaller than the freshwater to marine transition.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSmits, Adrianne; VanNieuwenhuyse, Erwin; Dahlgren, Randy; Stumpner, Paul. 2023-01-24.

            "description": " The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. DATA CORRECTION/UPDATE: Previous data versions 244.6, 244.7, and 244.8 contained an error and resulted in duplicated records of hatchery Chinook Salmon in the datasets. These datasets were removed from the data repository and the error was corrected in version 244.9 and after.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Summer Townet Survey (STN) and Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) are two long-term monitoring projects conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to monitor fish abundance and distribution trends in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) since 1959 and 1967, respectively. Starting in 2005, zooplankton monitoring was added and paired with fish tows to investigate food availability for young fishes. Food limitation has been a long-term issue and a focus of the Pelagic Organism Decline (POD) studies that began in 2005. By 2011, STN routinely conducted zooplankton monitoring at 40 stations, and FMWT at 32 stations in the upper SFE from Carquinez Strait to the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel and into the South Delta. STN samples every other week from June to August and FMWT samples once monthly from September to December. Both projects collect mesozooplankton samples using a modified Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net to target copepods and cladocerans, and FMWT also samples macrozooplankton (i.e. mysids and amphipods) using a mysid net. Flowmeters are used to measure the volume sampled to determine zooplankton catch per unit effort. Environmental variables such as water temperature, turbidity, secchi, and electrical conductivity are collected with each zooplankton sample. Concurrent fish and zooplankton tows conducted by STN and FMWT have allowed for comparisons of fish diet to the available zooplankton prey at the time of collection.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBreining-Aday, Spencer; Slater, Steven; Burdi, Christina. 2025-01-02.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program San Francisco Estuary 20-mm Survey was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in 1995 to monitor the distribution and abundance of post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Delta Smelt are considered to be an annual fish endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary that spawn in early spring and rear through the summer and fall in fresh to brackish water. Young of the Year (YOY) Delta Smelt are considered juveniles at sizes greater than or equal to 20-mm, and this survey targets those Delta Smelt. The 20-mm Survey currently samples 61 stations at fixed locations from San Pablo Bay through Suisun Bay and into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta every other week from March to July.  The survey has historically sampled between 41 and 55 stations. At each station, three 10-minute stepped oblique tows are conducted for fish. Each stepped oblique tow follows a tow schedule to sample the water column up to 32 ft, and the volume of water sampled is estimated using a General Oceanics flowmeter. The net is a cone shaped plankton net composed of 1600\u03bcm mesh and measuring 5.5 meters in length with a mouth area of 1.51m2 lashed onto a rigid D-frame with skis. Post-larval and juvenile fish samples are preserved in the field in 10% Formalin dyed with Rose Bengal and brought back to the CDFW Stockton Lab for identification to species and enumeration under a microscope. Fish are measured to fork length or total length when fork is not present. At each station, environmental and water quality data are also collected, and include: top temperature, top and bottom electrical conductivity (normalized at 25 degree C), secchi (cm), surface water clarity (FNU), and tidal condition.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBrennan, Colin; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica. 2024-10-30.

            "description": " The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) is simultaneously a central hub of\n    water delivery in California and home to commercially important and\n    endangered fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, Green Sturgeon, and Delta\n    and Longfin Smelt. Extensive ecological monitoring has been\n    conducted for over 50 years, mainly under the auspices of the\n    Interagency Ecological Program for the San Francisco Estuary\n    (https://iep.ca.gov/). We integrated fish catch and length data from\n    10 long-term monitoring surveys in the SFE. The integrated database\n    contains survey-level data such as environmental variables and\n    sampling effort in addition to the fish-level species, lengths, and\n    counts. Zero catches have been filled in for any species not caught\n    in a sample. The geographic scope includes San Francisco Bay through\n    the upper estuary, and the timeseries spans 1959 to 2024. Sampling\n    methods, gear, fish length metric, and other factors differ among\n    the component surveys. Sampling designs (locations and temporal\n    frequency) have also changed over time. Thus, it is highly\n    recommended to inspect the documentation of the component surveys\n    for more information on their methods.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBashevkin, Samuel; Nguyen, Trinh; Tham, Enoch; Gaeta, Jereme; Mitchell, Lara; Khanna, Shruti; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Stagg, Jacob; McKenzie, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Arrambide, Adriana; Huber, Eric; Marcetti, Donald; Steinhart, Geoffrey; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Erly, Kate; Cook, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Bigham, Gershom; Supervisory Fish Biologist, Denise, Goodman; Senegal, Taylor; Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Siddiqui, Samreen; Assen, Geir; Afentoulis, Virginia; Griffiths, Walter; Damon, Lauren; CDFW; Teejay, O'Rear; John, Durand; Peter, Moyle; CDFW; CDFW. 2024-08-02.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Summer Townet Survey (STN) is a long-term effort to monitor the annual recruitment success of young pelagic fishes in the upper San Francisco Estuary (California, United States). Conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) since 1959, STN has sampled fixed locations from Eastern San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista on the Sacramento River, and to Stockton on the San Joaquin River; and a single station in the lower Napa River. The study area was expanded in 2011 to include the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (SDWSC) and Cache Slough (CS). Currently, 40 stations are sampled as a \u201csurvey\u201d every other week June through August for 6 surveys. A conical net, lashed to a fixed metal \u201cD\u201d frame, is pulled obliquely through the water column 2 to 3 times at each station. All fish and macro-invertebrates are identified and enumerated from each tow, with fork lengths (mm) of the first 50 of each fish species also recorded. Fish catch, length-frequency, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) among stations is available with data visualization tools on the study website for all species (https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey). Data collected at historic 31 stations are used to calculate annual relative abundance indices for age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The remaining 9 stations are sampled to expand our sampling range further upriver and increase our understanding of larval and juvenile fish abundance and distribution in the lower Napa River and the North Delta. A meso-zooplankton net targeting copepods and cladocerans is also used in parallel to assess fish food resources at each station and a subset of the fish collected are retained for diet analysis by CDFW researchers (beginning 2005, see STN and FMWT zooplankton data on EDI). The STN also measures habitat conditions via water temperature (\u00b0C), water clarity (Secchi disk depth in cm), Turbidity (NTU) and specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm). Historically, STN began in response to the development of Central Valley Project pumping plants exporting water from the South Delta. STN continues to monitor fish abundance and distribution in relation to water diversions, for the operation of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, and management flow actions to improve summer-fall habitat conditions. Managers and researchers use the data collected by STN to inform decisions and improve our understanding of the health of the upper San Francisco Estuary.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nJohnson, Margaret; Rohlin, Taylor; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Ugbah, Nene; Rocha, Allegra; Slater, Steven; Malinich, Timothy; White, James; Burdi, Christina. 2025-10-08.
