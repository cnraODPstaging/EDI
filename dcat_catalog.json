            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1.\tCollect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2.\tAnalyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3.\tProvide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Baerwaldt, Crystal; Torres, Francheska; Niemela, Amanda; Vance, Lisa. 2025-12-11.

A report on the study was submitted to the State Water Resources Control Board on June 1, 2022. This data package contains all publicly available data used in the report, including visual cyanobacteria reports, cyanotoxin data, water quality, nutrients, flow/hydrodynamics, chlorophyll-a concentrations, temperature, coverage of SAV and FAV, use of herbicides, and human populations. Many of these data were derived from other datasets, though some were collected specifically for this study\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Rasmussen, Nicholas; Flynn, Theodore; Bouma-Gregson, Keith; Khanna, Shruti; Frantzich, Jared; Battey, Morgan; Perry, Sarah; Bashevkin, Samuel; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Perry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany; Klotz, Vivian; Khanna, Shruti; Ustin, Susan; Lay, Mui; Andrew, Margaret; Santos, Maria; Hestir, Erin; Shapiro, Kristen; Bellvert, Joaquim; Greenberg, Jonathan; Khanna, Shruti; Ustin, Susan; Bashevkin, Samuel; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth. 2023-05-03.

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Drift invertebrate and ichthyoplankton catch and water quality from the Sacramento River channel, and Sacramento River floodplain and tidal slough, collected by the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program, 1998-2022",
            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. Aquatic and terrestrial insects are an important component in the diet of juvenile and adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including two important native fishes: juvenile Chinook Salmon and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects drift invertebrates year-round from two sites. Currently, samples are collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using a rectangular aquatic drift net that sits at the surface of the water. Invertebrates are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc.). The goals of the monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends of aquatic and terrestrial insects/non-insects within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Drift invertebrate Key findings to date include: (1) Chinook Salmon sampled in the floodplain had diets comprised of 90% Dipterans and zooplankton, with Chironomidae being the dominant Diptera family (Sommer et al., 2001), (2) The floodplain of the Yolo Bypass contains significantly higher densities of Diptera (Diptera densities being positively associated with flow) and terrestrial invertebrates than the adjacent Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2001b: Sommer et al. 2004: Sommer et al. 2007), (3) A major portion of the diet of juvenile Sacramento Splittail are chironomid larvae (Kurth and Nobriga 2001, Moyle et al. 2004, Sommer et al. 2007), and (4) The Yolo Bypass was the site of the discovery of a new aestivating and winter emerging chironomid; Hydrobaenus saetheri (Cranston et al. 2007). The collection of ichthyoplankton is one of multiple elements of the YBFMP. Currently, the YBFMP collects ichthyoplankton in the Yolo Bypass from January to July. Historically, ichthyoplankton were also sampled in the Sacramento River, but due to low catch, this was stopped in 2019. Sampling is conducted with a 500-micron mesh conical plankton net. Fish are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc). The initial goal of ichthyoplankton monitoring was to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain (Sommer et al. 2003). The collection of ichthyoplankton samples is an important element in determining the annual presence, timing, and recruitment success of fishes utilizing the Yolo Bypass. Data on ichthyoplankton and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset. Key findings to date include: (1) 26 species of fish larvae were observed in the Yolo Bypass during the 20-years of monitoring (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data), including Delta Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus (Sommer et al 2004); (2) The native Prickly Sculpin and non-native Threadfin Shad dominated samples, contributing to over 60% of the total larval catch (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (3) Native species made up a higher percent of total catch in the Yolo Bypass (22.43%) in comparison to in the Sacramento River (10.2%), and appeared earlier in the year than many non-natives (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (4) Similar to other seasonal floodplains in the San Francisco Estuary, alien fishes made up a large portion of the assemblage of early life stages in the Yolo Bypass (Sommer et al 2004); (5) Water temperature and stage are the best explanatory environmental variables for larval fish abundance in the Yolo Bypass (p=0.001). Flow was not statistically significant (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (6) Species richness and diversity are higher in the Yolo bypass in comparison to in the Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2004).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa. 2024-12-11.

The objectives of the EMP are to obtain consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring stations, provide and document information necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards, and to report this information for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary. While the EMP also collects biological data, this dataset only includes the discrete water quality and nutrient data collected by the EMP from 1975-2021.

            "description": " To manage the critically low 2021 water supply for beneficial uses, DWR installed the temporary emergency drought barrier (EDB) on West False River in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta (Delta), approximately 5 miles south of Rio Vista, California, in Contra Costa County in June 2021. To monitor the effectiveness and impacts of the EBD, a monitoring program was initiated to track changes in hydrodynamics, water quality, fish, harmful algal blooms, and aquatic weeds in the vicinity of the EDB. The EDB was left in place during the winter of 2021-2022 and removed in fall of 2022. This data set includes all data collected as part of that monitoring program and subsets of ongoing monitoring programs that were used in the final effectiveness report for the EDB.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Huston, David; Frantzich, Jared; Salman, Tyler; Ateljevich, Eli; Clark, Kevin; Bergman, Paul; Klambach, Andrew; Wilder, Rick; Silva, Matthew; Hassrick, Jason; Hinkelman, Travis; Spaulding, Taylor; Slater, Steven; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; McKenzie, Ryan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Stagg, Jacob; Hagen, Jackie; Huber, Eric; Steinhart, Geoffrey; Arrambide, Adriana; Siddiqui, Samreen; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina. 2024-06-04. 2021-2022 West False River Emergency Drought Barrier water quality, flow, and fish monitoring ver 2.

            "description": " Projected temperature increases due to global climate change are likely to have localized impacts on the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Increased water temperature in the SFE will lead to challenges for managing water resources. Many native species, such as salmon and smelt, rely on cooler water, and will be further stressed by increased water temperature, which may cause them to seek microrefugia. While several state and federal agencies in the SFE collect real-time water temperature data, most of the water temperature collection sites are at a fixed location or floating near the surface of the water column. This dataset includes four real-time water quality stations that provide water temperature data for both the surface and bottom positions in the water column. We obtained surface water temperature data from an integrated hourly water temperature dataset (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/7385985f68b02c0deb2a9e425a9f3ad8). This dataset included data downloaded from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC; https://cdec.water.ca.gov/) and cleaned with a series of quality control (QC) checks (see integrated dataset metadata).  We obtained bottom temperature data from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) internal database Water Quality Portal (WQP). Data were integrated and standardized to hourly water temperature data in degrees Celsius, and the same series of quality control (QC) checks from the surface dataset were applied in a consistent manner to all stations. Bottom temperatures were selected from surface temperatures to provide measures of temperature difference. Datasets included in this package include source hourly surface and bottom data, both obtained from DWR\u2019s WQP, as well as an integrated dataset of cleaned hourly surface and bottom data, with calculated surface-bottom temperature differences. Both datasets are filtered to the timeframe used in an analysis of surface-bottom temperature differences.  Additionally, information regarding current and historical sensors used for water temperature data collection was obtained from station managers for each station and compiled in a metadata table.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nNelson, Michelle; Pien, Catarina. 2021-12-22.

The main objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to collect baseline data on lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and insect drift), juvenile and adult fish, hydrology, and water quality parameters. As the Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by numerous regulatory agencies, these baseline data are critical for evaluating success of future restoration projects. In addition, the data have already served to increase our understanding of the role of the Yolo Bypass in the life history of native fishes, and its ecological function in the San Francisco Estuary. Zooplankton are an important component in the diet of larval, juvenile, and small adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, Striped Bass, and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects zooplankton year-round from two sites. Since 2011, samples have been collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using 150- and 50- micrometer mesh plankton nets. Zooplankton are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently BSA Environmental Services). The goals of the zooplankton monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variation in species densities and trends between (1) the Sacramento River channel, and (2) the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Data on zooplankton catch and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole. 2021-12-09.

            "title": "Monitoring juvenile Chinook salmon outmigration using rotary screw traps on the Sacramento River at Knights Landing",
            "description": " Since 1995, the rotary screw traps (RSTs) at Knights Landing have\n    provided water management agencies an early warning of emigrating\n    juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead\n    trout (O. mykiss) making their way to the Sacramento-San Joaquin\n    Delta (Delta). Due to the proximity of the site to other major\n    tributaries of the Sacramento River, such as the Feather and\n    American Rivers, it is assumed that salmonids captured at the\n    Knights Landing RSTs originate from the upper Sacramento River and\n    its tributaries, a stretch of river that provides spawning and\n    rearing habitat for all four runs of natural origin Chinook salmon:\n    winter-run (State and federally listed as endangered), spring-run\n    (State and federally listed as threatened), late fall-run and\n    fall-run, as well as steelhead trout (federally listed as\n    threatened). The near real-time information RST monitoring data provides on\n    emigration timing and relative abundance for protected runs of\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead improves the ability for\n    resource agencies and water managers to implement protective\n    measures that help them navigate through the maze of waterways in\n    the Delta. By utilizing emigration data in adaptive management,\n    reservoir releases, export rates, water transfers, and Delta Cross\n    Channel Gate operations can be modified to minimize the risk of\n    predation, entrainment, and take, thereby maximizing juvenile\n    salmonid survival through the Delta. The primary goals of the Knights Landing Monitoring Program are to\n    (1) Provide early warning of listed salmonids emigrating toward the\n    Delta, (2) Document passage of emigrating salmonids including\n    timing, relative abundance, and environmental conditions, (3)\n    Develop passage estimates of salmonids emigrating through the lower\n    Sacramento River above the Delta, and (4) Develop a long-term\n    dataset on juvenile salmonid emigration to compare changes over\n    time. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) issued ITP\n    2081-2019-066-00 to DWR on March 31, 2020, for the long-term\n    operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the Delta. Condition\n    7.5.2 of the ITP requires the development and establishment of a\n    spring-run Chinook salmon juvenile production estimate (JPE) to\n    increase understanding of the impacts water operations have on the\n    spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. Data from the Knights Landing RST will be used along\n    with other datasets from juvenile salmonid monitoring programs in\n    the Sacramento River Watershed to inform the development of JPE\n    modeling approaches. Salmonid data collected from the Knights Landing RST, among other\n    datasets, is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to\n    understand the movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed to estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon that have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time\n    operations monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2\n    of the ITP which meets weekly from October through June, to provide\n    advice for real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and\n    the Water Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBauer, Nick. 2025-12-03.

            "description": " CDFW issued Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) to the\n    California Department of Water Resources (DWR) on March 31, 2020,\n    for the long-term operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the\n    Sacramento San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Condition 7.5.2 of the ITP\n    requires the development and establishment of a spring-run Chinook\n    salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) juvenile production estimate (JPE)\n    to increase understanding of the impacts that water operations have\n    on the spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and to inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. As a part of the JPE effort, CDFW began operating a new rotary screw\n    trap (RST) monitoring station on the lower Feather River near River\n    Mile 17, approximately 1 mile downstream of Star Bend Park and Boat\n    Ramp near Olivehurst, in January 2022. This RST location represents\n    the lowest point in the Feather River Watershed where juvenile\n    salmon are sampled with an RST prior to entering the Sacramento\n    River and includes salmon emigrating from the Yuba River. The\n    expanded juvenile monitoring effort will help resource agencies and\n    water managers identify numbers of salmon emigrating from the\n    Feather River Watershed and contributing to the spring-run Chinook\n    salmon population entering the Delta. Monitoring is conducted annually from October through June utilizing\n    a pair of eight-foot rotary screw traps (RST). Data collected at the\n    Lower Feather River RST site provides information on the temporal\n    distribution, relative abundance, and race composition of juvenile\n    Chinook salmon; and temporal distribution and relative abundance of\n    steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the Feather River and\n    tributaries, including the Yuba River, to the Delta. Salmonid data\n    collected from the Lower Feather River RST, among other datasets, is\n    also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the\n    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to\n    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that\n    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring\n    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets\n    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time\n    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation\n    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLoera, Gabe. 2025-12-16.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Zooplankton abundance in the Upper San Francisco Estuary from 1972-2021, an integration of 7 long-term monitoring programs",
            "description": " The upper San Francisco Estuary is an inland inverse delta formed by\n    the confluence of 5 major rivers that drain 40% of the land in\n    California (USA). It is a central hub of water delivery in\n    California and home to a number of commercially important and\n    endangered fish, such as Chinook Salmon, Green Sturgeon, and Delta\n    Smelt. To monitor the environmental impacts of water exports from\n    this system, extensive ecological monitoring has been conducted\n    since the 1960s. To track lower trophic levels, zooplankton\n    abundance has been monitored from 1972 to present. Starting with\n    just one survey (the CA Department of Water Resources\u2019 [CDWR] and\n    California Department of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s [CDFW] Environmental\n    Monitoring Program) in 1972, the suite of zooplankton surveys\n    gradually expanded with time. Several surveys traditionally focused\n    on monitoring fish abundance added zooplankton nets to their\n    sampling programs. The CDFW 20-mm larval fish survey added\n    zooplankton sampling in 1995, the CDWR Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring\n    Program add zooplankton in 1999, the CDFW Summer Townet Survey added\n    zooplankton in 2005, and the Fall Midwater Trawl added zooplankton\n    in 2007. Two new sampling programs, the Fish Restoration Program and\n    Directed Outflow Project, began in 2015 and 2017, respectively. All\n    sampling programs continue today. Each survey samples once or twice\n    monthly at set of fixed or random stations that varies across\n    surveys depending on their objectives. While the Environmental\n    Monitoring Program samples year-round, the other surveys are mostly\n    seasonal, although additional months were sampled in some years.\n    Most surveys target open channels although the Fish Restoration\n    Program samples in or near shallow tidal wetlands. Three size\n    classes of zooplankton are targeted by these sampling programs with\n    different net mesh sizes: micro zooplankton (copepods and rotifers)\n    are targeted with a 43 \u00b5m mesh net, meso zooplankton (copepods and\n    cladocerans) are targeted with 150 - 160 \u00b5m mesh nets, and macro\n    zooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with 500-505 \u00b5m mesh\n    nets. We have integrated data from all 7 surveys and 3 size classes\n    into a powerful long-term record of zooplankton in the San Francisco\n    Estuary, representing over 80,000 zooplankton samples and over 2\n    billion estimated zooplankton captured by the nets in these surveys.\n    Over the duration of this zooplankton dataset, the zooplankton\n    community species composition has almost completely turned over\n    after a series of species invasions from East Asia, numerous drought\n    cycles have come and gone, and important fish species have\n    dramatically declined during the Pelagic Organism Decline in 2002,\n    likely due in part to reduced food supply from zooplankton. Data\n    from the individual surveys have been used in prior studies to\n    investigate issues related to species invasions, flows, fish diets\n    and population dynamics, zooplankton population dynamics, and\n    community ecology. Our integrated dataset offers new and\n    unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution to address these and other\n    questions with greater statistical power.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Battey, Morgan; Perry, Sarah; California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Hartman, Rosemary; Sherman, Stacy; Contreras, Dave; Ellis, Daniel; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Slater, Steven; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole; Schultz, Andrew; Kalmbach, Andrew; California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 2023-03-09.

Any taxa not counted by all datasets was either summed to a higher level that would be comparable with all datasets, or removed if it had no close relatives in all datasets. However, taxonomic resolution is not consistent over time. This dataset was created using the zooper R package v2.5.0 with Zoopsynther(Data_type='Community').

            "description": " The objective of this study was to assess the relative distributions\n  of non-native resident fishes occurring in littoral habitats during\n  the drought year of 2014 within the western and northern portion of\n  California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), USA. A number of\n  non-native resident fish species (e.g., black bass, Micropterus spp.)\n  in the Delta have undergone remarkable increases in density in the\n  early 2000s and they are potential predators of endangered native\n  fishes such as Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Delta\n  Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The Delta makes up the tidal\n  freshwater portion of the San Francisco Estuary in California;\n  however, the critically dry year of 2014 caused a considerable\n  intrusion of salinity field within this region and may have caused a\n  shift in the resident fish community. To evaluate the response of\n  non-native resident fishes to this salinity intrusion, a boat\n  electrofishing survey was conducted in November of 2014 in the western\n  and northern part of the Delta by the United States Fish and Wildlife\n  Service, Lodi, California Office as part of the Interagency Ecological\n  Program for the San Francisco Estuary. Replicate sampling was done for\n  each site in this study in order to account for false zeroes through\n  the estimation of capture probability.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; Kirsch, Joseph; Mahardja, Brian. 2019-10-23.

            "description": " The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. DATA CORRECTION/UPDATE: Previous data versions 244.6, 244.7, and 244.8 contained an error and resulted in duplicated records of hatchery Chinook Salmon in the datasets. These datasets were removed from the data repository and the error was corrected in version 244.9 and after.

            "description": " The San Francisco Bay Study (Bay Study) was established in 1980 to determine the effects of freshwater outflow on the abundance and distribution of fish and mobile crustaceans (bracyuran crabs and caridean shrimp) in the San Francisco Estuary, mainly downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Bay Study survey currently samples 52 open-water stations monthly from a research vessel with two types of trawl gear: a midwater trawl to sample pelagic fishes, and an otter trawl to sample demersal fishes, crabs, and shrimp. Historically, the study also included plankton sampling (1980-1989) for larval fish and crustaceans. Fish collected by the otter and midwater trawl are identified to species, counted, and a representative subsample is measured.  In addition, crabs from the otter trawl are identified, counted, sexed, and measured, and gelatinous zooplankton from the midwater trawl are identified and counted. Shrimp are retained from each otter trawl sample and returned to the laboratory for processing, which includes identification, counts, sex, and length. Additional data collected at each station includes water depth, Secchi, and a water column profile of temperature and conductivity. This data publication will include the fish, crab, gelatinous zooplankton (jellies), and water quality data. Some metadata are included for shrimp and publication of these data will follow. Metadata related to the plankton sampling will be included in the future when this data is published.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHieb, Kathy; Burns, Jillian; Soto, Kenji. 2025-10-21.
