            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1.\tCollect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2.\tAnalyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3.\tProvide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Baerwaldt, Crystal; Torres, Francheska; Niemela, Amanda; Vance, Lisa. 2025-12-11.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is difficult to visually distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to genetic lineage; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program compliance monitoring programs. The genetic lineage was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines. Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Drift invertebrate and ichthyoplankton catch and water quality from the Sacramento River channel, and Sacramento River floodplain and tidal slough, collected by the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program, 1998-2022",
            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. Aquatic and terrestrial insects are an important component in the diet of juvenile and adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including two important native fishes: juvenile Chinook Salmon and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects drift invertebrates year-round from two sites. Currently, samples are collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using a rectangular aquatic drift net that sits at the surface of the water. Invertebrates are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc.). The goals of the monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends of aquatic and terrestrial insects/non-insects within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Drift invertebrate Key findings to date include: (1) Chinook Salmon sampled in the floodplain had diets comprised of 90% Dipterans and zooplankton, with Chironomidae being the dominant Diptera family (Sommer et al., 2001), (2) The floodplain of the Yolo Bypass contains significantly higher densities of Diptera (Diptera densities being positively associated with flow) and terrestrial invertebrates than the adjacent Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2001b: Sommer et al. 2004: Sommer et al. 2007), (3) A major portion of the diet of juvenile Sacramento Splittail are chironomid larvae (Kurth and Nobriga 2001, Moyle et al. 2004, Sommer et al. 2007), and (4) The Yolo Bypass was the site of the discovery of a new aestivating and winter emerging chironomid; Hydrobaenus saetheri (Cranston et al. 2007). The collection of ichthyoplankton is one of multiple elements of the YBFMP. Currently, the YBFMP collects ichthyoplankton in the Yolo Bypass from January to July. Historically, ichthyoplankton were also sampled in the Sacramento River, but due to low catch, this was stopped in 2019. Sampling is conducted with a 500-micron mesh conical plankton net. Fish are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc). The initial goal of ichthyoplankton monitoring was to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain (Sommer et al. 2003). The collection of ichthyoplankton samples is an important element in determining the annual presence, timing, and recruitment success of fishes utilizing the Yolo Bypass. Data on ichthyoplankton and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset. Key findings to date include: (1) 26 species of fish larvae were observed in the Yolo Bypass during the 20-years of monitoring (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data), including Delta Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus (Sommer et al 2004); (2) The native Prickly Sculpin and non-native Threadfin Shad dominated samples, contributing to over 60% of the total larval catch (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (3) Native species made up a higher percent of total catch in the Yolo Bypass (22.43%) in comparison to in the Sacramento River (10.2%), and appeared earlier in the year than many non-natives (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (4) Similar to other seasonal floodplains in the San Francisco Estuary, alien fishes made up a large portion of the assemblage of early life stages in the Yolo Bypass (Sommer et al 2004); (5) Water temperature and stage are the best explanatory environmental variables for larval fish abundance in the Yolo Bypass (p=0.001). Flow was not statistically significant (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (6) Species richness and diversity are higher in the Yolo bypass in comparison to in the Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2004).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa. 2024-12-11.

The objectives of the EMP are to obtain consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring stations, provide and document information necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards, and to report this information for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary. While the EMP also collects biological data, this dataset only includes the discrete water quality and nutrient data collected by the EMP from 1975-2021.

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are presented in this dataset. The rotary screw trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine species abundance and life stage of juvenile outmigrants and resident small-bodied fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, and (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns. The fyke trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine abundance of migrating and resident adult fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, especially with regard to anadromous species, (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns, and (4) provide data on the timing and duration of species captured in the Yolo Bypass for comparison to those captured in other Sacramento Valley tributaries. The beach seine surveys are conducted in the Yolo Bypass\u2019s perennial channel (Toe Drain), inundated floodplain, disconnected inundated ponds, and perennial ponds. The objectives of Toe Drain and inundated floodplain beach seine sampling are: (1) to examine species abundance and composition in different water year types and inundation conditions, (2) to spatially compare fish abundance and diversity in the Yolo Bypass, and (3) to estimate growth rates and densities of salmon in the Yolo Bypass versus the Sacramento River. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. Key findings include: (1) YB is a major factor regulating year class strength of splittail (Sommer et al. 1997; Feyrer et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2007a); (2) YB is a key migration corridor for adult fish of several listed species and sport fish (Harrell and Sommer 2003; Johnston et al. 2020); (3) YB is one of the most important regional rearing areas for juvenile Chinook salmon (Sommer et al. 2001a; 2005; Goertler et al. 2017, 2018; Sommer et al. 2020); (4) YB provides habitat for endangered Delta Smelt and its congeners (Mahardja et al. 2019; Davis et al. 2022), (5) and YB is a source of phytoplankton to the food web of the San Francisco Estuary (Jassby and Cloern 2000; Schemel et al. 2003; Sommer et al. 2004a; Frantzich et al. 2018).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa; Kwan, Nicole. 2025-04-08.

            "description": " The Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) have the potential to increase low-salinity-zone habitat for endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus, California Endangered Species Act listed as Endangered, Federal Endangered Species Act listed as Threatened), and to allow them to more frequently occupy Suisun Marsh, especially Montezuma Slough, one of their most important rearing habitats. Operation of the SMSCG in summer and fall to improve Delta Smelt habitat are called for in the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take permit for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. To support the adaptive management of the action, the California Department of Water Resources and collaborating agencies monitored water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, clams, and fishes during the SMSCG management actions in 2018. Monitoring has continued during the summer and fall months of all subsequent years, including both those with and without actions. This data package includes data collected by the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) long-term monitoring programs supplemented with targeted sample collection where existing surveys lacked spatial or temporal coverage. Monitoring during no-action years will be used as a baseline for comparison during action years. This data package will be updated annually.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Rasmussen, Nick; Burdi, Christina; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Wells, Elizabeth; Stewart, Alan; Battey, Morgan; Nelson, Michelle; Tran, Andrew; Neumayr, Stephen; Perry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany; Klotz, Vivian; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Erly, Kate; Cook, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Bigham, Gershom; Supervisory Fish Biologist, Denise, Barnard; Senegal, Taylor. 2026-01-14.

Multi-year droughts are important and impactful features of California\u2019s Mediterranean climate and can fundamentally affect the water quality and the ecosystem response of the San Francisco Estuary and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This data set was assembled from data collected by long-term monitoring programs over the past 46 years (1975-2021) to evaluate how the estuary changed during multi-year droughts. Data include fish, zooplankton, jellyfish, clams, temperature, Secchi depth, and salinity as measured by fish and water quality surveys, as well as nutrients and chlorophyll measured by water quality surveys. These data are accompanied by hydrologic metrics including Delta Inflow, Delta Outflow, the position of the 2-PSU isohaline, residence time, and daily values of various continuous water quality stations located in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBosworth, David; Hartman, Rosemary; Twardochleb, Laura; Wells, Elizabeth; Bashevkin, Samuel; Sawyer, Evan; Burdi, Christina; Maguire, Amanda; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Barros, Arthur; Nelson, Peter; Flynn, Theodore; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Wells, Elizabeth; Interagency Ecological Program; Slater, Steven; Slater, Steven; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Slater, Steven; Barros, Arthur; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Hartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Rasmussen, Nicholas; Flynn, Theodore; Bouma-Gregson, Keith; Khanna, Shruti; Frantzich, Jared. 2024-06-07.

            "description": " Projected temperature increases due to global climate change are likely to have localized impacts on the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Increased water temperature in the SFE will lead to challenges for managing water resources. Many native species, such as salmon and smelt, rely on cooler water, and will be further stressed by increased water temperature, which may cause them to seek microrefugia. While several state and federal agencies in the SFE collect real-time water temperature data, most of the water temperature collection sites are at a fixed location or floating near the surface of the water column. This dataset includes four real-time water quality stations that provide water temperature data for both the surface and bottom positions in the water column. We obtained surface water temperature data from an integrated hourly water temperature dataset (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/7385985f68b02c0deb2a9e425a9f3ad8). This dataset included data downloaded from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC; https://cdec.water.ca.gov/) and cleaned with a series of quality control (QC) checks (see integrated dataset metadata).  We obtained bottom temperature data from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) internal database Water Quality Portal (WQP). Data were integrated and standardized to hourly water temperature data in degrees Celsius, and the same series of quality control (QC) checks from the surface dataset were applied in a consistent manner to all stations. Bottom temperatures were selected from surface temperatures to provide measures of temperature difference. Datasets included in this package include source hourly surface and bottom data, both obtained from DWR\u2019s WQP, as well as an integrated dataset of cleaned hourly surface and bottom data, with calculated surface-bottom temperature differences. Both datasets are filtered to the timeframe used in an analysis of surface-bottom temperature differences.  Additionally, information regarding current and historical sensors used for water temperature data collection was obtained from station managers for each station and compiled in a metadata table.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nNelson, Michelle; Pien, Catarina. 2021-12-22.

In addition to mercury, DWR collected organic carbon, total suspended sediment, chlorophyll-a, temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, turbidity, total chlorophyll, velocity, level, and flow data. To do this, three sets of data were collected: 1) velocity, level, and flow data were collected continuously using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, 2) continuous temperature, specific conductance, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and total chlorophyll were collected using a water quality sonde, and 3) THg, MeHg, organic carbon, total suspended sediment, and chlorophyll-a were collected via grab samples either by sampling pole or flow-weighted composites with an autosampler.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLee, Petra; Manning, Julianna. 2020-07-16.

            "description": " The Continuous Environmental Monitoring Program (CEMP) plays an instrumental role in overseeing real-time water quality in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) and Suisun Bay. The program harnesses wireless telemetry to transmit crucial data to the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), making high-resolution environmental data pertaining to the Delta and Suisun Bay publicly accessible. The extensive dataset captures information at 15-minute intervals from 15 monitoring stations, utilizing YSI 6600 and YSI EXO sondes to obtain standalone water quality measurements.  This extensive dataset informs the operations of the California State Water Project, ensuring it adheres to mandated water quality standards set by Water Right Decision 1641. This data compilation incorporates all information since the transition to YSI multiparameter sondes in 2005. It is important to note that the commencement dates and subsequent upgrades vary between stations, leading to slight discrepancies in the dataset's date ranges.  Since its inception in the mid-1980s, CEMP has progressively expanded its monitoring capabilities, consistently augmenting the number of monitoring locations and the array of water quality parameters assessed. Its commitment to utilizing the most advanced water quality monitoring technology reaffirms its position as an environmental monitoring leader in the Delta and Suisun Bay. Today, the program oversees 15 water quality stations that reliably capture data every 15 minutes, each day of the year, transmitting this data in real-time.  The core tenents of CEMP: \u2022 to obtain consistent and accurate data in real-time at established monitoring stations \u2022 to provide data necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards \u2022 to perform data analyses for further understanding of estuarine ecology \u2022 to report information to other government agencies, as well as the public, for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE). \u2022 to provide continuous water quality monitoring expertise for other groups within DWR and sister agencies for the benefit of ecological studies throughout the San Francisco- Sacramento Estuary\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nNelson, Michelle; Tran, Andrew. 2025-04-22.

            "description": " The Enhanced Large Fish Study (ELFS) was established and included in the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) work plan in 2023 to fill some of the monitoring gap of fishes in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California. The fish monitoring of the IEP prior to ELFS primarily consisted of trawl- and seine-based surveys, which generally capture small and/or juvenile fishes due to survey gear and methodologies. In order to more effectively sample the large/adult fish portion of SFE fish communities, the ELFS uses American Fisheries Society experimental gillnets, plus the inclusion of the optional \"large fish panel,\" to sample the waters of the SFE. The experimental gillnets measure 24.4m in length, 1.8m in depth, and includes eight 3m length panels with stretch mesh measurements of 76.2mm, 114.3mm, 50.8mm, 88.9mm, 38.1mm, 127.0mm, 63.5mm, and 101.6mm. The optional large fish panel measures 9.1m by 1.8m in depth and includes three 3m length panels with stretch mesh measurements of 152.4, 177.8, and 203.2mm. The ELFS conducted its first year of sampling in the North Delta, California, in 2023, and will be expanded to the greater Delta and Suisun Bay and Marsh in future sampling years. The ELFS is currently funded as a special study to inform future monitoring, with funding contracted through fiscal year 2026-2027.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStompe, Dylan; Hobbs, James. 2023-11-01.

            "description": " Since 1999, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has\n    conducted annual snorkel surveys to monitor juvenile salmon on the\n    Feather River. The objective of this data collection effort is to\n    determine the relative abundance and distribution of rearing\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead. A secondary objective is to\n    collect baseline data for future monitoring programs associated with\n    habitat restoration projects. Crews survey units within 20 sampling\n    sections on the high flow (HFC) and low flow channel (LFC) between\n    January and September and collect information on species, fish size,\n    substrate, cover, and habitat type. This dataset represents an\n    extensive time series that could be used to identify habitat\n    conditions where juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead occur and how\n    these conditions have changed over time. These data were published\n    to support the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCampos, Casey. 2024-09-27.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Fish catch and associated water quality for the Fall Midwater Trawl Survey, Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 1967-2024",
            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Fall Midwater Trawl Survey (FMWT) is a long-term monitoring survey conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and has sampled annually since its inception in 1967, with the exceptions of 1974 and 1979, when sampling was not conducted. The FMWT was initiated to determine the relative abundance and distribution of age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) in the San Francisco Estuary (California, United States), but the data has also been used for other upper estuary pelagic species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), American Shad (Alosa sapidissima), Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), and Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense). The FMWT currently samples 130 stations each month from September to December and a subset of this data is used to calculate an annual abundance index. These 130 stations range from San Pablo Bay upstream to Stockton on the San Joaquin River, and West Sacramento on the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. FMWT sampling data includes 193 unique station locations throughout the San Francisco Estuary; 63 are not currently sampled.  Most stations no longer sampled occur in South and Central San Francisco Bay (1968-1979), with others located in San Pablo Bay and upstream into the Delta. There are catch records for stations that were sampled only once. Data users are encouraged to look at station frequency over time to understand when and where sampling occurred. Sampling takes approximately 14 days per month to complete. Historically, FMWT sampling occasionally began as early as July (1972) or August (1968-1973, 1993-1994, 1996-1997) and sometimes continued past December to March (1968-1973, 1978, 1991-2001) or beyond (1992-1995). The Spring Midwater Trawl (SMWT) was a modified survey created to continue sampling January-March to track movements of mature adult delta smelt from 1991-2001. SMWT was replaced in 2002 with the more effective Spring Kodiak Trawl (SKT). All fish, shrimp, and jellyfish are identified and enumerated. In addition, the crew measures water temperature (\u00b0C), specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm), Secchi depth, and Turbidity (NTU). FMWT also currently collects meso- (copepods and cladocerans) and macro- (mysids and amphipods) zooplankton samples at 35 stations. Midwater and zooplankton tows conducted by FMWT allow for determination of available zooplankton prey resources. FMWT equipment and methods have remained consistent since the survey's inception, which allows annual abundance indices to be compared across time. Monthly and annual abundance indices are calculated using catch data from 100 \u201cindex\u201d stations grouped into 14 regional \u201careas\u201d. Monthly indices are calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for all 14 areas. Annual abundance indices are the sum of the 4 (September-December) monthly indices.  The FMWT catch data has been used to meet permit obligations to the State Water Resources Control Board (SW and DRCB) via Water Rights Decisions (D-1485 and D-1641) and USFWS-NMFS biological opinions for Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), and for incidental take permits issued by CDFW for operation of Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP).

            "description": " The objective of this study was to assess the relative distributions\n  of non-native resident fishes occurring in littoral habitats during\n  the drought year of 2014 within the western and northern portion of\n  California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), USA. A number of\n  non-native resident fish species (e.g., black bass, Micropterus spp.)\n  in the Delta have undergone remarkable increases in density in the\n  early 2000s and they are potential predators of endangered native\n  fishes such as Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Delta\n  Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The Delta makes up the tidal\n  freshwater portion of the San Francisco Estuary in California;\n  however, the critically dry year of 2014 caused a considerable\n  intrusion of salinity field within this region and may have caused a\n  shift in the resident fish community. To evaluate the response of\n  non-native resident fishes to this salinity intrusion, a boat\n  electrofishing survey was conducted in November of 2014 in the western\n  and northern part of the Delta by the United States Fish and Wildlife\n  Service, Lodi, California Office as part of the Interagency Ecological\n  Program for the San Francisco Estuary. Replicate sampling was done for\n  each site in this study in order to account for false zeroes through\n  the estimation of capture probability.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; Kirsch, Joseph; Mahardja, Brian. 2019-10-23.

            "description": " The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. DATA CORRECTION/UPDATE: Previous data versions 244.6, 244.7, and 244.8 contained an error and resulted in duplicated records of hatchery Chinook Salmon in the datasets. These datasets were removed from the data repository and the error was corrected in version 244.9 and after. DNA Data: Full more details of the DNA methods and results for juvenile Chinook salmon included in this dataset, please check out Blankenship, S.M., J. Israel, E. Buttermore, and K. Reece. 2021.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program San Francisco Estuary 20-mm Survey was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in 1995 to monitor the distribution and abundance of post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Delta Smelt are considered to be an annual fish endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary that spawn in early spring and rear through the summer and fall in fresh to brackish water. Young of the Year (YOY) Delta Smelt are considered juveniles at sizes greater than or equal to 20-mm, and this survey targets those Delta Smelt. The 20-mm Survey currently samples 61 stations at fixed locations from San Pablo Bay through Suisun Bay and into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta every other week from March to July.  The survey has historically sampled between 41 and 55 stations. At each station, three 10-minute stepped oblique tows are conducted for fish. Each stepped oblique tow follows a tow schedule to sample the water column up to 32 ft, and the volume of water sampled is estimated using a General Oceanics flowmeter. The net is a cone shaped plankton net composed of 1600\u03bcm mesh and measuring 5.5 meters in length with a mouth area of 1.51m2 lashed onto a rigid D-frame with skis. Post-larval and juvenile fish samples are preserved in the field in 10% Formalin dyed with Rose Bengal and brought back to the CDFW Stockton Lab for identification to species and enumeration under a microscope. Fish are measured to fork length or total length when fork is not present. At each station, environmental and water quality data are also collected, and include: top temperature, top and bottom electrical conductivity (normalized at 25 degree C), secchi (cm), surface water clarity (FNU), and tidal condition.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBrennan, Colin; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica. 2024-10-30.
