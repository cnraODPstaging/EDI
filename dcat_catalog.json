            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1.\tCollect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2.\tAnalyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3.\tProvide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Baerwaldt, Crystal; Torres, Francheska; Niemela, Amanda; Vance, Lisa. 2025-12-11.

            "description": " The upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE) is simultaneously a central\n    hub of water delivery in California and home to commercially\n    important and endangered fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, Green\n    Sturgeon, and Delta and Longfin Smelt. Extensive ecological\n    monitoring has been conducted for over 50 years, mainly under the\n    auspices of the Interagency Ecological Program for the San Francisco\n    Estuary (https://iep.ca.gov/). We integrated water quality data from\n    16 boat-based long-term monitoring surveys in the upper SFE. This\n    integrated dataset includes measurements of temperature (surface and\n    bottom), conductivity (surface), salinity (surface), Secchi depth,\n    qualitative concentration of the toxic alga Microcystis\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Battey, Morgan; Perry, Sarah; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); McKenzie, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Nanninga, Adam; Cook, John; Hagen, Jackie; Mahardja, Brian; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Senegal, Taylor; Mckenzie, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Perales, Brynn; Bridgman, David; Erly, Kate; Staiger, Stephen; Arrambide, Adriana; Gilbert, Morgan; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Lesmeister, Sarah; Rinde, Jenna; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Kwan, Nicole; Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Damon, Lauren; Temple, Trishelle; Chorazyczewski, Adam; J, Cloern; T, Schraga; T, Schraga; E, Nejad; C, Martin; J, Cloern; CDFW; CDFW; CDFW; Teejay, O'Rear; John, Durand; Peter, Moyle; USBR; R, Dahlgren; L, Loken; E, Van Nieuwenhuyse; U.S. Geological Survey; CDWR. 2023-06-08.

            "description": " In summer 2018 we used a unique water control structure in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) to direct a managed flow pulse into Suisun Marsh, one of the largest contiguous tidal marshes on the west coast of the United States.  The action was designed to increase habitat suitability for the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a small osmerid fish endemic to the upper SFE.  The approach was to operate the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) in conjunction with increased Sacramento River tributary inflow to direct an estimated 160 x 10^6 m3 pulse of low salinity water into Suisun Marsh during August, a critical time period for juvenile Delta Smelt rearing. This dataset includes physical and biological monitoring data collected for the action. Datasets include Delta Smelt catch from the USFWS Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program, zooplankton and Microcystis abundance from the Environmental Monitoring Program, historic Delta Smelt catch from the Summer Townet Survey, Delta Outflow from the Dayflow model, extent of Delta Smelt habitat from the UnTRIM Bay-Delta model, and water quality (Salinity, Temperature, Chlorophyll, and Turibidity) collected at continuous sondes at three locations. These data are associated with the manuscript \"Evaluation of a large-scale flow manipulation to the upper San Francisco Estuary: Response of habitat conditions for an endangered native fish,\" by Dr. Ted Sommer, et al. 2020 PLOS One, in review.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Sommer, Ted; Koohafkan, Michael; Burdi, Christina; Bever, Aaron; MacWilliams, Michael; Galef, Jeff; Barros, Arthur; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Johnston, Catherine; Lee, Sunny; Mahardja, Brian; Speegle, Jonathan; Barnard, Denise; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen. 2020-07-30.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

Wireless telemetry is used to transmit real-time provisional data to the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), making the data publicly available. The published dataset is quality controlled and quality assured providing detailed information at 15-minute intervals from 18 monitoring stations, using Xylem\u2019s YSI EXO2 and YSI 6600 multiparameter sondes to document individual water quality measurements of multiple water quality parameters. The dataset informs operations for the California State Water Project and supports water quality monitoring required by Water Right Decision D-1641, the Delta Compliance Program, the South Delta Temporary Barriers and the South Delta Improvement Program. It is important to note that the start dates and subsequent equipment upgrades vary between stations and equipment leading to discrepancies in the dataset\u2019s date ranges.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFrantzich, Jared; Huynh, Elena. 2025-10-08.

            "description": " California Department of Water Resources (DWR) currently operates\n    multiple eight-foot rotary screw traps (RSTs) at Hallwood Boulevard\n    RM 7.5. RST operations were conducted by CDFW and then under the\n    direction of the Yuba River Management Team from 1999 to 2009 at the\n    Hallwood Boulevard site; and resumed in 2022 by DWR. The Hallwood\n    site will essentially sample all areas of the lower Yuba River\n    upstream of Hallwood Boulevard. Additionally, the Hallwood site is\n    located downstream of the bulk of adult Chinook salmon spawning\n    areas and downstream of all known spring-run Chinook salmon\n    spawning. Data are currently being used to inform the development of\n    a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring-run Chinook salmon\n    in the Sacramento River Watershed as required by Incidental Take\n    Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 issued by CA Department of Fish and\n    Wildlife (CDFW) to DWR for the long-term operation of the State\n    Water Project. Data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCampos, Casey. 2025-07-09.

            "description": " The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) conducts\n    juvenile salmonid emigration monitoring on Butte Creek at the\n    Parrot-Phelan Diversion Dam near Chico, California. Monitoring is\n    conducted annually from October through June utilizing an 8-ft\n    diameter rotary screw trap (RST) and a diversion screen trap (DST).\n    Data from this monitoring is used to estimate juvenile spring-run\n    Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) abundance and passage,\n    identify alevin emergence timing, document juvenile size at\n    emigration, and document rearing and emigration patterns. This data\n    will also be used to inform the development of a juvenile production\n    estimate (JPE) for spring-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed as required by Condition of Approval 7.5.2 of Incidental\n    Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) issued by CDFW to California\n    Department of Water Resources (DWR) for the long-term operation of\n    the State Water Project. Salmonid data collected from the Butte\n    Creek RST, among other datasets, is also used by the Salmon\n    Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the movement of juvenile salmon\n    in the Sacramento River Watershed to estimate the number of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that have entered the\n    Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). SaMT is a real-time operations\n    monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP\n    which meets weekly from October through June, to provide advice for\n    real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water\n    Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and\n    spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHenley, Grant. 2026-01-28.

            "description": " The Enhanced Large Fish Study (ELFS) was established and included in the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) work plan in 2023 to fill some of the monitoring gap of fishes in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California. The fish monitoring of the IEP prior to ELFS primarily consisted of trawl- and seine-based surveys, which generally capture small and/or juvenile fishes due to survey gear and methodologies. In order to more effectively sample the large/adult fish portion of SFE fish communities, the ELFS uses American Fisheries Society experimental gillnets, plus the inclusion of the optional \"large fish panel,\" to sample the waters of the SFE. The experimental gillnets measure 24.4m in length, 1.8m in depth, and includes eight 3m length panels with stretch mesh measurements of 76.2mm, 114.3mm, 50.8mm, 88.9mm, 38.1mm, 127.0mm, 63.5mm, and 101.6mm. The optional large fish panel measures 9.1m by 1.8m in depth and includes three 3m length panels with stretch mesh measurements of 152.4, 177.8, and 203.2mm. The ELFS conducted its first year of sampling in the North Delta, California, in 2023, and will be expanded to the greater Delta and Suisun Bay and Marsh in future sampling years. The ELFS is currently funded as a special study to inform future monitoring, with funding contracted through fiscal year 2026-2027.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStompe, Dylan; Hobbs, James. 2023-11-01.

The objective of this data collection effort is to\n    determine the relative abundance and distribution of rearing\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead. A secondary objective is to\n    collect baseline data for future monitoring programs associated with\n    habitat restoration projects. Crews survey units within 20 sampling\n    sections on the high flow (HFC) and low flow channel (LFC) between\n    January and September and collect information on species, fish size,\n    substrate, cover, and habitat type. This dataset represents an\n    extensive time series that could be used to identify habitat\n    conditions where juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead occur and how\n    these conditions have changed over time. These data were published\n    to support the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCampos, Casey. 2024-09-27.

            "description": " The effects of increasing water temperature on species in the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta is of growing importance for conservation and resource management; however, species metrics of temperature sensitivity vary across agency groups and can result in varied understanding and predictions of species vulnerability and modeling. Here, we provide a catalogue of key temperature metrics for several species in the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta that may be used as a standard for scientists studying temperature effects and resource management of native and non-native species. The dataset includes both documented physiological thresholds for suboptimal and upper temperature tolerances from metrics such as growth or critical and lethal limits, as well as calculated minimum, maximum and mean temperature values of species catch in the Delta from long-term monitoring surveys from 1954-2022. Species include critical estuarine fishes such as Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Chinook Salmon, and sturgeon, as well as the species they interact with such as invasive fishes and invertebrates, cyanobacteria, and aquatic vegetation. The dataset includes values for different life-stages where possible and references for information. This information can help guide conservation measures and species management needed to lessen the impact stressful temperature conditions.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nDavis, Brittany; Bush, Eva; Lehman, Peggy; Pien, Catarina. 2025-02-05.

Fishes are commonly\n  preserved in formalin; however, formalin preservation is associated\n  with reduced fish length and increased weight, but the magnitude and\n  timing of these changes may vary among species. Unaccounted for\n  preservation-driven shifts in fish length and weight may have drastic\n  effects on any conservation or ecological conclusions drawn from\n  specimen preserved for various durations as well as when compared to\n  fresh, unpreserved specimen. The \u200bpurpose of this study was to \u200btest\n  whether formalin fixation and preservation affects endangered Delta\n  Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSlater, Steven; Burdi, Christina; Gaeta, Jereme; Frick, Madeleine. 2020-08-31.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " Projected temperature increases due to global climate change are\n  likely to have localized impacts on the San Francisco Estuary (SFE).\n  Increased water temperature in the SFE will lead to challenges for\n  managing water resources. Many native species, such as salmon and\n  smelt, rely on cooler water, and will be further stressed by increased\n  water temperature. While real-time water temperature is collected by\n  several state and federal agencies in the San Francisco Estuary, a\n  landscape-scale synthesis of available water temperature data has not\n  been conducted for the SFE. For this dataset, we compiled continuous\n  water temperature data and associated metadata from the SFE to\n  generate an integrated and usable dataset of known quality for climate\n  and ecological analysis. Data were obtained from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC;\n  https://cdec.water.ca.gov/) for consistency (data are untreated) and\n  efficiency (existing code to download data directly from CDEC). Data\n  were integrated and standardized to hourly water temperature data in\n  degrees Celsius. A series of quality control (QC) checks were then\n  applied in a consistent manner to all stations. Datasets included in\n  this package include raw hourly data, flagged data, and filtered data\n  (where flagged data are removed). Additionally, information regarding\n  current and historical sensors used for water temperature data\n  collection was obtained from station managers for each station, and\n  compiled in a metadata table.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Hamilton, Jasmine; Hartman, Rosemary; Nelson, Michelle; Saraceno, JohnFranco; Schreier, Brian; Davis, Brittany; Department of Water Resources. 2020-08-23.

            "description": " The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. DATA CORRECTION/UPDATE: Previous data versions 244.6, 244.7, and 244.8 contained an error and resulted in duplicated records of hatchery Chinook Salmon in the datasets. These datasets were removed from the data repository and the error was corrected in version 244.9 and after.

            "description": " The Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring Program (EDSM) was initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016. The main purpose of EDSM is to provide information about endemic Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) population sizes and distributions within the upper San Francisco Estuary. To track the life cycle of this annual species, larval trawling with a fine-mesh (20 mm) net is conducted during the spring months, and Kodiak trawling for juveniles and adults occurs during the summer, fall, and winter months. Sampling sites are chosen via a stratified random sampling design. A minimum of two tows are conducted at each site, and field staff typically sample between 18 and 41 sites weekly. All fish collected are identified and enumerated, and a subset are measured for body length. Environmental data (water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, depth) are also measured. In addition to Hypomesus spp., this long-term monitoring dataset can also be useful in evaluating the status and trends of other species of interest, especially pelagic fishes.
