            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1.\tCollect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2.\tAnalyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3.\tProvide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Baerwaldt, Crystal; Torres, Francheska; Niemela, Amanda; Vance, Lisa. 2025-12-11.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is difficult to visually distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to genetic lineage; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program compliance monitoring programs. The genetic lineage was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines. Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

The raw YBFMP\u2019s water temperature data was collected by loggers\n      attached to the rotary screw trap (STTD) and Sherwood Harbor (SHR). Logger data ranged from\n      daily means (1998) to a fifteen-minute collection interval (2013-2017 for the Yolo Bypass,\n      2009-2019 for Sherwood Harbor). A daily mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and\n      coefficient of variation in water temperature was produced as well as columns for sample size\n      (n, number of measurements per day), method (data collection or estimation), category, length\n      (number of consecutive missing dates) and site. Daily water temperature data for the full\n      extent of the YBFMP\u2019s fish collection is valuable for a variety of purposes. For example,\n      variation in water temperature during inundation and comparisons between temperatures in the\n      Sacramento River and Yolo Bypass have been used as metrics of habitat complexity and linked to\n      life history diversity in salmon (Goertler et al. 2017).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoertler, Pascale ; Pien, Catarina; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Hamilton, Jasmine; Hartman, Rosemary; Nelson, Michelle; Saraceno, JohnFranco; Schreier, Brian; Davis, Brittany; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Kwan, Nicole. 2022-07-27.

The objectives of the EMP are to obtain consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring stations, provide and document information necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards, and to report this information for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary. While the EMP also collects biological data, this dataset only includes the discrete water quality and nutrient data collected by the EMP from 1975-2021.

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are presented in this dataset. The rotary screw trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine species abundance and life stage of juvenile outmigrants and resident small-bodied fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, and (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns. The fyke trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine abundance of migrating and resident adult fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, especially with regard to anadromous species, (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns, and (4) provide data on the timing and duration of species captured in the Yolo Bypass for comparison to those captured in other Sacramento Valley tributaries. The beach seine surveys are conducted in the Yolo Bypass\u2019s perennial channel (Toe Drain), inundated floodplain, disconnected inundated ponds, and perennial ponds. The objectives of Toe Drain and inundated floodplain beach seine sampling are: (1) to examine species abundance and composition in different water year types and inundation conditions, (2) to spatially compare fish abundance and diversity in the Yolo Bypass, and (3) to estimate growth rates and densities of salmon in the Yolo Bypass versus the Sacramento River. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. Key findings include: (1) YB is a major factor regulating year class strength of splittail (Sommer et al. 1997; Feyrer et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2007a); (2) YB is a key migration corridor for adult fish of several listed species and sport fish (Harrell and Sommer 2003; Johnston et al. 2020); (3) YB is one of the most important regional rearing areas for juvenile Chinook salmon (Sommer et al. 2001a; 2005; Goertler et al. 2017, 2018; Sommer et al. 2020); (4) YB provides habitat for endangered Delta Smelt and its congeners (Mahardja et al. 2019; Davis et al. 2022), (5) and YB is a source of phytoplankton to the food web of the San Francisco Estuary (Jassby and Cloern 2000; Schemel et al. 2003; Sommer et al. 2004a; Frantzich et al. 2018).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa; Kwan, Nicole. 2025-04-08.

            "description": " The Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) have the potential to increase low-salinity-zone habitat for endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus, California Endangered Species Act listed as Endangered, Federal Endangered Species Act listed as Threatened), and to allow them to more frequently occupy Suisun Marsh, especially Montezuma Slough, one of their most important rearing habitats. Operation of the SMSCG in summer and fall to improve Delta Smelt habitat are called for in the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take permit for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. To support the adaptive management of the action, the California Department of Water Resources and collaborating agencies monitored water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, clams, and fishes during the SMSCG management action in 2018 and subsequent summer and fall months of non-action years (2019-2022). This data package includes data collected by the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) long-term monitoring programs supplemented with targeted sample collection where existing surveys lacked spatial or temporal coverage. Monitoring during no-action years will be used as a baseline for comparison during action years. This data package will be updated annually during both action years and non-action years.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Rasmussen, Nick; Burdi, Christina; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Wells, Elizabeth; Stewart, Alan; Nelson, Michelle; Tran, Andrew; Neumayr, Stephen; Perry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany; Klotz, Vivian; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Erly, Kate; Cook, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Bigham, Gershom; Supervisory Fish Biologist, Denise, Barnard; Senegal, Taylor. 2024-10-23.

            "description": " The Department of Water Resources (DWR) North Central Region Office (NCRO) Water Quality Evaluation Section (WQES) and the Division of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) provide technical expertise and program support for regulatory compliance, water operations, emergency response, and environmental restoration. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are large overgrowths of algae in eutrophic marine or freshwater ecosystems that degrade beneficial uses of water resources, from aesthetics to habitat quality to human consumption. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta has observed an increasing number of HABs, especially in the South Delta. These HABs have been composed primarily of cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (BGA). The most prevalent HAB producing cyanobacteria in recent years is the freshwater species Microcystis aeruginosa - a known producer of toxins called microcystins. Microcystins negatively affect the health of aquatic and terrestrial organisms alike, including humans and their pets. In late 2017, the Central Valley Water Resources Control Board (CVWRCB) issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification for the DWR South Delta Temporary Barriers Projects. This certification required DWR to develop a dataset of surface Microcystis Visual Index (MVI) values during standard water quality station visits. In addition to the MVI, requirements for DWR to collect water samples for phytoplankton enumeration and cyanotoxin analysis began in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Together these data help DWR and CVWRCB to understand the distribution and composition of the algal community in the South Delta and to evaluate the species that contribute to HABs.  As a separate project, DWR O&M collects cyanotoxin and taste and odor samples at Clifton Court Forebay and the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant to ensure that the water exported from the Delta is safe for use. This dataset provides an ongoing collection of taste and odor and cyanotoxin analysis beginning in 2009 and 2012, respectively.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFrantzich, Jared; Rosenow, Brooke. 2025-09-18.

            "title": "Monitoring juvenile Chinook salmon outmigration using rotary screw traps on the Sacramento River near Tisdale Weir",
            "description": " The Tisdale RST sampling site is operated by the California\n    Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to obtain information on the\n    temporal distribution, relative abundance, and composition of race\n    and species of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)\n    and steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the upper Sacramento\n    River and tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta).\n    The project collects data near the Tisdale Weir on the Sacramento\n    River, using two paired rotary screw traps (RSTs) outfitted with two\n    8-ft diameter cones. The RST monitoring site at Tisdale Weir was established meet a\n    requirement of the 2011 amendment to the reasonable and prudent\n    alternative (RPA) of the 2009 biological and conference opinion (BO)\n    on the long-term operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and\n    State Water Project (SWP). The amendment required the Bureau of\n    Reclamation (USBR) and the California Department of Water Resources\n    (DWR) to fund a new juvenile salmonid monitoring site on the\n    Sacramento River between Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD) and Knights\n    Landing. The purpose of the new site was to provide early warning of\n    fish movement and determine survival of listed fish species leaving\n    spawning habitat in the upper Sacramento River. CDFW issued ITP 2081-2019-066-00 to DWR on March 31, 2020, for the\n    long-term operation of the SWP in the Delta. Condition 7.5.2 of the\n    ITP requires the development and establishment of a spring-run\n    Chinook salmon juvenile production estimate (JPE) to increase\n    understanding regarding the impacts water operations have on the\n    spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. Data from the Tisdale RST will be used along with other\n    datasets from juvenile salmonid monitoring programs in the\n    Sacramento River Watershed to inform the development of JPE modeling\n    approaches. Salmonid data collected from the Tisdale RST, among other datasets,\n    is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the\n    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to\n    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that\n    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring\n    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets\n    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time\n    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation\n    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHuneycutt, Andrew. 2025-03-01.

            "description": " The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) conducts\n    juvenile salmonid emigration monitoring on Butte Creek at the\n    Parrot-Phelan Diversion Dam near Chico, California. Monitoring is\n    conducted annually from October through June utilizing an 8-ft\n    diameter rotary screw trap (RST) and a diversion screen trap (DST).\n    Data from this monitoring is used to estimate juvenile spring-run\n    Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) abundance and passage,\n    identify alevin emergence timing, document juvenile size at\n    emigration, and document rearing and emigration patterns. This data\n    will also be used to inform the development of a juvenile production\n    estimate (JPE) for spring-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed as required by Condition of Approval 7.5.2 of Incidental\n    Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) issued by CDFW to California\n    Department of Water Resources (DWR) for the long-term operation of\n    the State Water Project. Salmonid data collected from the Butte\n    Creek RST, among other datasets, is also used by the Salmon\n    Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the movement of juvenile salmon\n    in the Sacramento River Watershed to estimate the number of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that have entered the\n    Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). SaMT is a real-time operations\n    monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP\n    which meets weekly from October through June, to provide advice for\n    real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water\n    Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and\n    spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHenley, Grant. 2025-10-29.

            "description": " The Cache Slough Complex is an ecologically significant area, with many restoration efforts of various kinds set to take place within its boundaries. These efforts which are tied to regulations set forth by the Biological Opinion, will have unknown impacts to in\u2010stream water quality. For this reason, the Department of Water Resources\u2019 Water Quality Assessment (WQA) unit developed a monitoring program to establish baseline water quality measurements to help understand the environmental impact of these restoration projects and ensure pre\u2010restoration water quality data is available to compare against post-restoration water quality. To do so, data was collected at various sites that represent all major inputs and outflows within the Cache Slough Complex from September 2013 to December 2021.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nDel Cid, Jeremy; Brown, Travis. 2024-08-07.

            "description": " Since 1999, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has\n    conducted annual snorkel surveys to monitor juvenile salmon on the\n    Feather River. The objective of this data collection effort is to\n    determine the relative abundance and distribution of rearing\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead. A secondary objective is to\n    collect baseline data for future monitoring programs associated with\n    habitat restoration projects. Crews survey units within 20 sampling\n    sections on the high flow (HFC) and low flow channel (LFC) between\n    January and September and collect information on species, fish size,\n    substrate, cover, and habitat type. This dataset represents an\n    extensive time series that could be used to identify habitat\n    conditions where juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead occur and how\n    these conditions have changed over time. These data were published\n    to support the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCampos, Casey. 2024-09-27.

            "title": "Directed Outflow Project Lower Trophic Study",
            "description": " The upper San Francisco Bay Estuary and Sacramento San Joaquin Delta is critical habitat for the endemic Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered planktivorous fish with an annual, semi-anadromous life cycle. Freshwater outflow actions during the fall season are hypothesized to improve Delta Smelt habitat and therefore Delta Smelt condition before the spawning life stage. As part of efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of such actions to benefit Delta Smelt populations, various studies were initiated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation under the Directed Outflow Project (DOP). One component of the DOP was to evaluate how the Fall X2 freshwater outflow action changed the lower trophic prey available to Delta Smelt. The action is hypothesized to change abiotic and biotic aspects that can benefit Delta Smelt habitat by using freshwater outflow to maintain the position of X2 (defined as the distance in kilometers from the Golden Gate Bridge to the tidally averaged 2 ppt salinity isohaline) at around 70 km during wet or above normal precipitation water years. This moves the low salinity zone (0.5 - 6 ppt) further seaward into Suisun Bay which increases the area of preferred Delta Smelt habitat. Field sampling began the September of 2017 and occurred bi-weekly through the end of November, paired with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program. Three random sites were sampled per target region (Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, the Lower Sacramento River, the Cache Slough Complex, and the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel) per week. Sites were chosen using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified design. During 2018, sampling was increased to weekly and in 2019-2020 sampling began in April and ended in November. Sampling occurs for three different habitat types: shoal, channel surface and channel deep at each site depending on the depth of the water column. The shoal habitat is less than 10 feet, channel habitat is greater than 10 feet and channel deep habitat is greater than 20 feet. Plankton nets are towed approximately 0.5-meters below the surface in shoal and channel habitats and targeting the lower half to lower third of the water column in channel deep habitats. Two size classes of zooplankton are targeted using a pair of nets with different mesh sizes: mesozooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with a 150 micrometer mesh net and macrozooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with a 500 micrometer mesh net. Before each zooplankton tow water quality variables (temperature, dissolve oxygen, turbidity, specific conductivity, salinity, pH, and chlorophyll-a) are measured using a YSI EXO 2 sonde, 1 meter below the surface for channel surface and shoal habitats or at the target tow depth for channel deep habitats. Alongside zooplankton tows, phytoplankton samples are taken from a water sample and preserved in a Lugol's solution. In addition, whole water samples are filtered for nutrient (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and dissolved organic carbon) and chlorophyll-a analysis. These samples are only taken at the channel surface and shoal habitats. This dataset has been used in numerous manuscripts, reports, and technical reports to examine the state of the lower trophic food web in the context of available food for Delta Smelt.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSchultz, Andrew; Kalmbach, Andrew. 2023-05-15.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

The objective of this\n    data collection effort is to quantify and understand potential shits\n    in redd distribution and potential habitat differences between\n    historic and restored sites. The redd surveys are conducted in the\n    uppermost 16 miles of the lower Feather River though have been\n    concentrated in the uppermost two miles of the lower Feather River\n    in, and adjacent to the Gravel Supplementation Areas (GSAs). Redd\n    surveys are conducted less frequently in the 14 miles downstream of\n    the GSAs. Surveys typically begin in mid-September at the onset of\n    spawning and generally conclude at the end of November. This dataset\n    represents an extensive time series that could be used to identify\n    habitat conditions where Chinook salmon spawn, how these conditions\n    have changed over time, especially in areas where restoration has\n    occurred. These data were published to support the Healthy Rivers\n    and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCook, Chris. 2025-03-06.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Fall Midwater Trawl Survey (FMWT) is a long-term monitoring survey conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and has sampled annually since its inception in 1967, with the exceptions of 1974 and 1979, when sampling was not conducted. The FMWT was initiated to determine the relative abundance and distribution of age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) in the San Francisco Estuary (California, United States), but the data has also been used for other upper estuary pelagic species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), American Shad (Alosa sapidissima), Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), and Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense). The FMWT currently samples 130 stations each month from September to December and a subset of this data is used to calculate an annual abundance index. These 130 stations range from San Pablo Bay upstream to Stockton on the San Joaquin River, and West Sacramento on the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. FMWT sampling data includes 193 unique station locations throughout the San Francisco Estuary; 63 are not currently sampled.  Most stations no longer sampled occur in South and Central San Francisco Bay (1968-1979), with others located in San Pablo Bay and upstream into the Delta. There are catch records for stations that were sampled only once. Data users are encouraged to look at station frequency over time to understand when and where sampling occurred. Sampling takes approximately 14 days per month to complete. Historically, FMWT sampling occasionally began as early as July (1972) or August (1968-1973, 1993-1994, 1996-1997) and sometimes continued past December to March (1968-1973, 1978, 1991-2001) or beyond (1992-1995). The Spring Midwater Trawl (SMWT) was a modified survey created to continue sampling January-March to track movements of mature adult delta smelt from 1991-2001. SMWT was replaced in 2002 with the more effective Spring Kodiak Trawl (SKT). All fish, shrimp, and jellyfish are identified and enumerated. In addition, the crew measures water temperature (\u00b0C), specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm), Secchi depth, and Turbidity (NTU). FMWT also currently collects meso- (copepods and cladocerans) and macro- (mysids and amphipods) zooplankton samples at 35 stations. Midwater and zooplankton tows conducted by FMWT allow for determination of available zooplankton prey resources. FMWT equipment and methods have remained consistent since the survey's inception, which allows annual abundance indices to be compared across time. Monthly and annual abundance indices are calculated using catch data from 100 \u201cindex\u201d stations grouped into 14 regional \u201careas\u201d. Monthly indices are calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for all 14 areas. Annual abundance indices are the sum of the 4 (September-December) monthly indices.  The FMWT catch data has been used to meet permit obligations to the State Water Resources Control Board (SW and DRCB) via Water Rights Decisions (D-1485 and D-1641) and USFWS-NMFS biological opinions for Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), and for incidental take permits issued by CDFW for operation of Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP).

            "description": " The Fish Restoration Program Monitoring Team assesses the biological effectiveness of 8,000+ acres of tidal wetland restoration in the Upper San Francisco Estuary (Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh) through a contract with the CA Department of Water Resources. The restoration is pursuant to requirements in the 2008/2009 and 2019 Biological Opinions for state and federal water project operations. Data on fish and invertebrate abundance on or near these sites was collected as baseline monitoring data and to determine the most efficient methods for monitoring wetlands. Understanding how invertebrate, fish, and phytoplankton communities change pre- to post-restoration is essential to evaluating the benefits of tidal wetlands to native fish species. Invertebrate data was collected using sweep nets, benthic cores, neuston nets, and zooplankton trawls. Fish data was collected using otter trawls, lampara nets, and beach seines. For each method, the team recorded the catch of fish, invertebrates, and other organisms, length of selected organisms, and a suite of environmental information, including: dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, and dissolved organic carbon. Additional water quality samples, processed for Chlorophyll a, Dissolved Ammonia, Dissolved Nitrite + Nitrate, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Dissolved Organic Nitrogen, Dissolved Ortho-phosphate, Pheophytin a, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Total Organic Carbon, Total Phosphorus, and Total Suspended Solids, were collected at a subset of sampling sites. Data are collected before and after restoration at project and reference sites (Before-After-Control-Impact-design), as well as at adjacent water bodies.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBowles, Christy; Sherman, Stacy; Avila, Michelle; Cox, Daniel; Murray, Emma; Chavez, Amanda; Dungey, Darian; Ng, Gabriel; Hartman, Rosemary; Ellis, Daniel; Contreras, Dave. 2025-04-30.

            "description": " Projected temperature increases due to global climate change are\n  likely to have localized impacts on the San Francisco Estuary (SFE).\n  Increased water temperature in the SFE will lead to challenges for\n  managing water resources. Many native species, such as salmon and\n  smelt, rely on cooler water, and will be further stressed by increased\n  water temperature. While real-time water temperature is collected by\n  several state and federal agencies in the San Francisco Estuary, a\n  landscape-scale synthesis of available water temperature data has not\n  been conducted for the SFE. For this dataset, we compiled continuous\n  water temperature data and associated metadata from the SFE to\n  generate an integrated and usable dataset of known quality for climate\n  and ecological analysis. Data were obtained from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC;\n  https://cdec.water.ca.gov/) for consistency (data are untreated) and\n  efficiency (existing code to download data directly from CDEC). Data\n  were integrated and standardized to hourly water temperature data in\n  degrees Celsius. A series of quality control (QC) checks were then\n  applied in a consistent manner to all stations. Datasets included in\n  this package include raw hourly data, flagged data, and filtered data\n  (where flagged data are removed). Additionally, information regarding\n  current and historical sensors used for water temperature data\n  collection was obtained from station managers for each station, and\n  compiled in a metadata table.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Hamilton, Jasmine; Hartman, Rosemary; Nelson, Michelle; Saraceno, JohnFranco; Schreier, Brian; Davis, Brittany; Department of Water Resources. 2020-08-23.

            "description": " Drivers of phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics vary spatially and temporally in estuaries due to variation in hydrodynamic exchange and residence time, complicating efforts to understand controls on food web productivity. We conducted approximately monthly (2012 \u2013 2019; n = 74) longitudinal sampling at ten fixed stations along a freshwater tidal terminal channel in the San Francisco Estuary, California, characterized by seaward to landward gradients in water residence time, turbidity, nutrient concentrations, and plankton community composition. We used multivariate autoregressive state space (MARSS) models to quantify environmental (abiotic) and biotic controls on phytoplankton and mesozooplankton biomass. The importance of specific abiotic drivers (e.g. water temperature, turbidity, nutrients) and trophic interactions differed significantly among hydrodynamic exchange zones with different mean residence times. Abiotic drivers explained more variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics than a model including only trophic interactions, but individual phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions explained more variation than individual abiotic drivers. Interactions between zooplankton and phytoplankton were strongest in landward reaches with the longest residence times and the highest zooplankton biomass. Interactions between cryptophytes and both copepods and cladocerans were stronger than interactions between bacillariophytes (diatoms) and zooplankton taxa, despite contributing less biovolume in all but the most landward reaches. Our results demonstrate that trophic interactions and their relative strengths vary in a hydrodynamic context, contributing to food web heterogeneity within estuaries at spatial scales smaller than the freshwater to marine transition.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSmits, Adrianne; VanNieuwenhuyse, Erwin; Dahlgren, Randy; Stumpner, Paul. 2023-01-24.

            "description": " The Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring Program (EDSM) was initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016. The main purpose of EDSM is to provide information about endemic Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) population sizes and distributions within the upper San Francisco Estuary. To track the life cycle of this annual species, larval trawling with a fine-mesh (20 mm) net is conducted during the spring months, and Kodiak trawling for juveniles and adults occurs during the summer, fall, and winter months. Sampling sites are chosen via a stratified random sampling design. A minimum of two tows are conducted at each site, and field staff typically sample between 18 and 41 sites weekly. All fish collected are identified and enumerated, and a subset are measured for body length. Environmental data (water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, depth) are also measured. In addition to Hypomesus spp., this long-term monitoring dataset can also be useful in evaluating the status and trends of other species of interest, especially pelagic fishes.

            "description": " The San Francisco Bay Study (Bay Study) was established in 1980 to determine the effects of freshwater outflow on the abundance and distribution of fish and mobile crustaceans (bracyuran crabs and caridean shrimp) in the San Francisco Estuary, mainly downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Bay Study survey currently samples 52 open-water stations monthly from a research vessel with two types of trawl gear: a midwater trawl to sample pelagic fishes, and an otter trawl to sample demersal fishes, crabs, and shrimp. Historically, the study also included plankton sampling (1980-1989) for larval fish and crustaceans. Fish collected by the otter and midwater trawl are identified to species, counted, and a representative subsample is measured.  In addition, crabs from the otter trawl are identified, counted, sexed, and measured, and gelatinous zooplankton from the midwater trawl are identified and counted. Shrimp are retained from each otter trawl sample and returned to the laboratory for processing, which includes identification, counts, sex, and length. Additional data collected at each station includes water depth, Secchi, and a water column profile of temperature and conductivity. This data publication will include the fish, crab, gelatinous zooplankton (jellies), and water quality data. Some metadata are included for shrimp and publication of these data will follow. Metadata related to the plankton sampling will be included in the future when this data is published.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHieb, Kathy; Burns, Jillian; Soto, Kenji. 2025-10-21.

            "description": " The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) is simultaneously a central hub of\n    water delivery in California and home to commercially important and\n    endangered fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, Green Sturgeon, and Delta\n    and Longfin Smelt. Extensive ecological monitoring has been\n    conducted for over 50 years, mainly under the auspices of the\n    Interagency Ecological Program for the San Francisco Estuary\n    (https://iep.ca.gov/). We integrated fish catch and length data from\n    10 long-term monitoring surveys in the SFE. The integrated database\n    contains survey-level data such as environmental variables and\n    sampling effort in addition to the fish-level species, lengths, and\n    counts. Zero catches have been filled in for any species not caught\n    in a sample. The geographic scope includes San Francisco Bay through\n    the upper estuary, and the timeseries spans 1959 to 2024. Sampling\n    methods, gear, fish length metric, and other factors differ among\n    the component surveys. Sampling designs (locations and temporal\n    frequency) have also changed over time. Thus, it is highly\n    recommended to inspect the documentation of the component surveys\n    for more information on their methods.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBashevkin, Samuel; Nguyen, Trinh; Tham, Enoch; Gaeta, Jereme; Mitchell, Lara; Khanna, Shruti; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Stagg, Jacob; McKenzie, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Arrambide, Adriana; Huber, Eric; Marcetti, Donald; Steinhart, Geoffrey; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Erly, Kate; Cook, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Bigham, Gershom; Supervisory Fish Biologist, Denise, Goodman; Senegal, Taylor; Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Siddiqui, Samreen; Assen, Geir; Afentoulis, Virginia; Griffiths, Walter; Damon, Lauren; CDFW; Teejay, O'Rear; John, Durand; Peter, Moyle; CDFW; CDFW. 2024-08-02.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Summer Townet Survey (STN) is a long-term effort to monitor the annual recruitment success of young pelagic fishes in the upper San Francisco Estuary (California, United States). Conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) since 1959, STN has sampled fixed locations from Eastern San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista on the Sacramento River, and to Stockton on the San Joaquin River; and a single station in the lower Napa River. The study area was expanded in 2011 to include the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (SDWSC) and Cache Slough (CS). Currently, 40 stations are sampled as a \u201csurvey\u201d every other week June through August for 6 surveys. A conical net, lashed to a fixed metal \u201cD\u201d frame, is pulled obliquely through the water column 2 to 3 times at each station. All fish and macro-invertebrates are identified and enumerated from each tow, with fork lengths (mm) of the first 50 of each fish species also recorded. Fish catch, length-frequency, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) among stations is available with data visualization tools on the study website for all species (https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey). Data collected at historic 31 stations are used to calculate annual relative abundance indices for age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The remaining 9 stations are sampled to expand our sampling range further upriver and increase our understanding of larval and juvenile fish abundance and distribution in the lower Napa River and the North Delta. A meso-zooplankton net targeting copepods and cladocerans is also used in parallel to assess fish food resources at each station and a subset of the fish collected are retained for diet analysis by CDFW researchers (beginning 2005, see STN and FMWT zooplankton data on EDI). The STN also measures habitat conditions via water temperature (\u00b0C), water clarity (Secchi disk depth in cm), Turbidity (NTU) and specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm). Historically, STN began in response to the development of Central Valley Project pumping plants exporting water from the South Delta. STN continues to monitor fish abundance and distribution in relation to water diversions, for the operation of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, and management flow actions to improve summer-fall habitat conditions. Managers and researchers use the data collected by STN to inform decisions and improve our understanding of the health of the upper San Francisco Estuary.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nJohnson, Margaret; Rohlin, Taylor; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Ugbah, Nene; Rocha, Allegra; Slater, Steven; Malinich, Timothy; White, James; Burdi, Christina. 2025-10-08.
