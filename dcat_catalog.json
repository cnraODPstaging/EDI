            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1.\tCollect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2.\tAnalyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3.\tProvide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Baerwaldt, Crystal; Torres, Francheska; Niemela, Amanda; Vance, Lisa. 2025-12-11.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is difficult to visually distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to genetic lineage; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program compliance monitoring programs. The genetic lineage was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines. Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Drift invertebrate and ichthyoplankton catch and water quality from the Sacramento River channel, and Sacramento River floodplain and tidal slough, collected by the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program, 1998-2022",
            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. Aquatic and terrestrial insects are an important component in the diet of juvenile and adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including two important native fishes: juvenile Chinook Salmon and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects drift invertebrates year-round from two sites. Currently, samples are collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using a rectangular aquatic drift net that sits at the surface of the water. Invertebrates are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc.). The goals of the monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends of aquatic and terrestrial insects/non-insects within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Drift invertebrate Key findings to date include: (1) Chinook Salmon sampled in the floodplain had diets comprised of 90% Dipterans and zooplankton, with Chironomidae being the dominant Diptera family (Sommer et al., 2001), (2) The floodplain of the Yolo Bypass contains significantly higher densities of Diptera (Diptera densities being positively associated with flow) and terrestrial invertebrates than the adjacent Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2001b: Sommer et al. 2004: Sommer et al. 2007), (3) A major portion of the diet of juvenile Sacramento Splittail are chironomid larvae (Kurth and Nobriga 2001, Moyle et al. 2004, Sommer et al. 2007), and (4) The Yolo Bypass was the site of the discovery of a new aestivating and winter emerging chironomid; Hydrobaenus saetheri (Cranston et al. 2007). The collection of ichthyoplankton is one of multiple elements of the YBFMP. Currently, the YBFMP collects ichthyoplankton in the Yolo Bypass from January to July. Historically, ichthyoplankton were also sampled in the Sacramento River, but due to low catch, this was stopped in 2019. Sampling is conducted with a 500-micron mesh conical plankton net. Fish are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc). The initial goal of ichthyoplankton monitoring was to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain (Sommer et al. 2003). The collection of ichthyoplankton samples is an important element in determining the annual presence, timing, and recruitment success of fishes utilizing the Yolo Bypass. Data on ichthyoplankton and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset. Key findings to date include: (1) 26 species of fish larvae were observed in the Yolo Bypass during the 20-years of monitoring (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data), including Delta Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus (Sommer et al 2004); (2) The native Prickly Sculpin and non-native Threadfin Shad dominated samples, contributing to over 60% of the total larval catch (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (3) Native species made up a higher percent of total catch in the Yolo Bypass (22.43%) in comparison to in the Sacramento River (10.2%), and appeared earlier in the year than many non-natives (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (4) Similar to other seasonal floodplains in the San Francisco Estuary, alien fishes made up a large portion of the assemblage of early life stages in the Yolo Bypass (Sommer et al 2004); (5) Water temperature and stage are the best explanatory environmental variables for larval fish abundance in the Yolo Bypass (p=0.001). Flow was not statistically significant (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (6) Species richness and diversity are higher in the Yolo bypass in comparison to in the Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2004).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa. 2024-12-11.

The objectives of the EMP are to obtain consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring stations, provide and document information necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards, and to report this information for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary. While the EMP also collects biological data, this dataset only includes the discrete water quality and nutrient data collected by the EMP from 1975-2021.

            "description": " To manage the critically low 2021 water supply for beneficial uses, DWR installed the temporary emergency drought barrier (EDB) on West False River in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta (Delta), approximately 5 miles south of Rio Vista, California, in Contra Costa County in June 2021. To monitor the effectiveness and impacts of the EBD, a monitoring program was initiated to track changes in hydrodynamics, water quality, fish, harmful algal blooms, and aquatic weeds in the vicinity of the EDB. The EDB was left in place during the winter of 2021-2022 and removed in fall of 2022. This data set includes all data collected as part of that monitoring program and subsets of ongoing monitoring programs that were used in the final effectiveness report for the EDB.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Huston, David; Frantzich, Jared; Salman, Tyler; Ateljevich, Eli; Clark, Kevin; Bergman, Paul; Klambach, Andrew; Wilder, Rick; Silva, Matthew; Hassrick, Jason; Hinkelman, Travis; Spaulding, Taylor; Slater, Steven; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; McKenzie, Ryan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Stagg, Jacob; Hagen, Jackie; Huber, Eric; Steinhart, Geoffrey; Arrambide, Adriana; Siddiqui, Samreen; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina. 2024-06-04. 2021-2022 West False River Emergency Drought Barrier water quality, flow, and fish monitoring ver 2.

            "description": " The Department of Water Resources (DWR) North Central Region Office (NCRO) Water Quality Evaluation Section (WQES) and the Division of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) provide technical expertise and program support for regulatory compliance, water operations, emergency response, and environmental restoration. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are large overgrowths of algae in eutrophic marine or freshwater ecosystems that degrade beneficial uses of water resources, from aesthetics to habitat quality to human consumption. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta has observed an increasing number of HABs, especially in the South Delta. These HABs have been composed primarily of cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (BGA). The most prevalent HAB producing cyanobacteria in recent years is the freshwater species Microcystis aeruginosa - a known producer of toxins called microcystins. Microcystins negatively affect the health of aquatic and terrestrial organisms alike, including humans and their pets. In late 2017, the Central Valley Water Resources Control Board (CVWRCB) issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification for the DWR South Delta Temporary Barriers Projects. This certification required DWR to develop a dataset of surface Microcystis Visual Index (MVI) values during standard water quality station visits. In addition to the MVI, requirements for DWR to collect water samples for phytoplankton enumeration and cyanotoxin analysis began in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Together these data help DWR and CVWRCB to understand the distribution and composition of the algal community in the South Delta and to evaluate the species that contribute to HABs.  As a separate project, DWR O&M collects cyanotoxin and taste and odor samples at Clifton Court Forebay and the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant to ensure that the water exported from the Delta is safe for use. This dataset provides an ongoing collection of taste and odor and cyanotoxin analysis beginning in 2009 and 2012, respectively.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFrantzich, Jared; Rosenow, Brooke. 2025-09-18.

            "description": " Fish entrainment into California's State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) has been a source of mortality for native osmerid species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys). While entrained adult and juvenile fishes are collected, identified and enumerated, the facilities design does not allow for a quantifiable estimate of larval fishes being entrained. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for managers to make scientifically informed decisions regarding the endangered Longfin & Delta Smelt. The Larval Entrainment Study (LES) aims to address this gap by providing a high-resolution dataset and insights into the variable abundances of Smelt at risk of entrainment, the community composition surrounding them, and associated water quality data. Our study design utilizes a variety of gear types and maximizes replicates to improve the understanding of larval Smelt abundances within the southern reach of the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Delta, the zone of entrainment for the SWP and CVP. Sampling began in 2022 using 10-minute stepped oblique tows of a Smelt Larval Survey (SLS) sled mounted with a 500 \u03bcm net. Tows were conducted in West Canal, outside Clifton Court Forebay (CCF), where the risk of entrainment is highest. Sampling was conducted five days a week in 2022 and three days a week in the following years. . Beginning in mid-January 2023, a 940 \u03bcm mesh net with the same dimensions as the SLS net was added, with sampling alternating between the two. This provided an intermediate gear between SLS (500 \u03bcm) and 20mm (1600 \u03bcm) nets. In 2024 we expanded to sample a transect of sites within the Old and Middle River (OMR) corridor. This provides broader spatial resolution and improves our ability to detect Osmerids within the South Delta. Sampling alternated between a high priority day (with intensive sampling in the lower San Joaquin River, SLS stations 809 & 812) and a longer transect day that ran the length of the OMR corridor( at SLS stations 809, 812, 902, 915 & 918). We also began to sample using a bongo sled, which allows two nets to sample side by side. This data also includes our special studies; a day/night comparison conducted in 2022, a gear comparison in 2023, and a second day/night comparison study in 2024.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGilbert, Morgan; Malinich, Timothy; Griffiths, Kyle; Afentoulis, Virginia. 2025-10-27.

Data from this monitoring is used to estimate\n    juvenile spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)\n    (spring-run) abundance and passage, identify yearling outmigration\n    timing and alert resource agencies of juvenile spring-run presence\n    in the lower Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This data will be\n    included in the development of a juvenile production estimate (JPE)\n    for spring-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River as required by\n    Condition of Approval 7.5.2 of Incidental Take Permit No.\n    2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) issued by CDFW to California Department of\n    Water Resources (DWR) for the long-term operation of the State Water\n    Project. Salmonid data collected from the Mill and Deer RSTs, among\n    other datasets, is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to\n    understand the movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed to estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon that have entered the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta\n    (Delta). SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring team required by\n    Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets weekly from\n    October through June, to provide advice for real-time management of\n    SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation Management Team\n    (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon\n    in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nRevnak, Ryan. 2024-06-21.

            "description": " The Cache Slough Complex is an ecologically significant area, with many restoration efforts of various kinds set to take place within its boundaries. These efforts which are tied to regulations set forth by the Biological Opinion, will have unknown impacts to in\u2010stream water quality. For this reason, the Department of Water Resources\u2019 Water Quality Assessment (WQA) unit developed a monitoring program to establish baseline water quality measurements to help understand the environmental impact of these restoration projects and ensure pre\u2010restoration water quality data is available to compare against post-restoration water quality. To do so, data was collected at various sites that represent all major inputs and outflows within the Cache Slough Complex from September 2013 to December 2021.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nDel Cid, Jeremy; Brown, Travis. 2024-08-07.

            "description": " The Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s (Reclamation) Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California Department of Water Resource\u2019s (DWR) State Water Project (SWP) deliver millions of acre-feet of water annually for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and environmental needs in California from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta) through the C.W. \u201cBill\u201d Jones Pumping Plant (JPP) and Banks Pumping Plant.  Since 1957, a Reclamation operated fish salvage facility, the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF), is located upstream of the JPP and functions to salvage fish entrained in exported water (Bates and Vinsonhaler 1957).  Additionally, the John E. Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility (SDFPF) was added by the California Department of Water Resources in 1968 to salvage fishes diverted by the SWP.  The salvage process involves fish collection, counting, handling and transportation back to the Delta.  To prevent fish loss, CVP and SWP fish facilities were constructed at Old river, where fish are diverted to the fish facilities for counting and reporting.  After counting, the fish are collected in storage tanks and taken to several release locations in the Delta via fish-haul tank trucks.  Millions of fishes from 69 species are salvaged through this process by the two fish facilities.  Data collected includes species collected, fish lengths, water flow, export amounts, and water quality.  Fishes listed (Endangered Species Act (ESA) or California Endangered Species Act (CESA)) were Chinook Salmon, Delta Smelt, steelhead trout, Longfin Smelt, and Green Sturgeon.  The California Department of Fish and Wildlife monitors fish salvage and manages the data collected from the fish facilities in addition to data collected and managed by DWR and Reclamation.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAfentoulis, Virginia; Siddiqui, Samreen; Aasen, Geir; Griffiths, Walter; Malinich, Timothy; Damon, Lauren; Aasen, Geir; Aasen, Geir; Morinaka, Jerry; Reyes, Rene. 2025-07-11.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program's Smelt Larva Survey was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in 2009 to monitor the distribution and abundance of newly hatched Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) in the San Francisco Estuary. Surveys are conducted bi-weekly, and sampling begins in December and continues through mid-March. The SLS samples at fixed stations, from San Pablo Bay through Suisun Bay and into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Napa River stations were added in 2014 and the San Pablo Bay expansion stations were added in December 2022. Each sampling week currently consists of 59 stations. At each station, one 10-minute stepped oblique (bottom to top) tow is conducted following a prescribed tow schedule. The net is a conical 500 \u00b5m mesh lashed to a D-shaped frame mounted on skis. Larval fish samples are preserved in the field in 10% formalin and brought back to the CDFW Stockton Lab for identification and enumeration under a microscope. Several types of data are collected at each station in addition to the larval fish sample, including the volume of water sampled by the net, surface water temperature, surface and bottom specific conductance (EC normalized at 25\u02daC), Secchi disk depth, tow duration, tidal condition, and surface water turbidity.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBrennan, Colin; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica. 2025-09-11.

            "description": " Since 2014, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has\n    conducted annual Chinook salmon redd surveys. The objective of this\n    data collection effort is to quantify and understand potential shits\n    in redd distribution and potential habitat differences between\n    historic and restored sites. The redd surveys are conducted in the\n    uppermost 16 miles of the lower Feather River though have been\n    concentrated in the uppermost two miles of the lower Feather River\n    in, and adjacent to the Gravel Supplementation Areas (GSAs). Redd\n    surveys are conducted less frequently in the 14 miles downstream of\n    the GSAs. Surveys typically begin in mid-September at the onset of\n    spawning and generally conclude at the end of November. This dataset\n    represents an extensive time series that could be used to identify\n    habitat conditions where Chinook salmon spawn, how these conditions\n    have changed over time, especially in areas where restoration has\n    occurred. These data were published to support the Healthy Rivers\n    and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCook, Chris. 2025-03-06.

            "description": " The Fish Restoration Program Monitoring Team assesses the biological effectiveness of 8,000+ acres of tidal wetland restoration in the Upper San Francisco Estuary (Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh) through a contract with the CA Department of Water Resources. The restoration is pursuant to requirements in the 2008/2009 and 2019 Biological Opinions for state and federal water project operations. Data on fish and invertebrate abundance on or near these sites was collected as baseline monitoring data and to determine the most efficient methods for monitoring wetlands. Understanding how invertebrate, fish, and phytoplankton communities change pre- to post-restoration is essential to evaluating the benefits of tidal wetlands to native fish species. Invertebrate data was collected using sweep nets, benthic cores, neuston nets, and zooplankton trawls. Fish data was collected using otter trawls, lampara nets, and beach seines. For each method, the team recorded the catch of fish, invertebrates, and other organisms, length of selected organisms, and a suite of environmental information, including: dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, and dissolved organic carbon. Additional water quality samples, processed for Chlorophyll a, Dissolved Ammonia, Dissolved Nitrite + Nitrate, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Dissolved Organic Nitrogen, Dissolved Ortho-phosphate, Pheophytin a, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Total Organic Carbon, Total Phosphorus, and Total Suspended Solids, were collected at a subset of sampling sites. Data are collected before and after restoration at project and reference sites (Before-After-Control-Impact-design), as well as at adjacent water bodies.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBowles, Christy; Sherman, Stacy; Avila, Michelle; Cox, Daniel; Murray, Emma; Chavez, Amanda; Dungey, Darian; Ng, Gabriel; Hartman, Rosemary; Ellis, Daniel; Contreras, Dave. 2025-04-30.

            "description": " The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. DATA CORRECTION/UPDATE: Previous data versions 244.6, 244.7, and 244.8 contained an error and resulted in duplicated records of hatchery Chinook Salmon in the datasets. These datasets were removed from the data repository and the error was corrected in version 244.9 and after.

            "description": " The San Francisco Bay Study (Bay Study) was established in 1980 to determine the effects of freshwater outflow on the abundance and distribution of fish and mobile crustaceans (bracyuran crabs and caridean shrimp) in the San Francisco Estuary, mainly downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Bay Study survey currently samples 52 open-water stations monthly from a research vessel with two types of trawl gear: a midwater trawl to sample pelagic fishes, and an otter trawl to sample demersal fishes, crabs, and shrimp. Historically, the study also included plankton sampling (1980-1989) for larval fish and crustaceans. Fish collected by the otter and midwater trawl are identified to species, counted, and a representative subsample is measured.  In addition, crabs from the otter trawl are identified, counted, sexed, and measured, and gelatinous zooplankton from the midwater trawl are identified and counted. Shrimp are retained from each otter trawl sample and returned to the laboratory for processing, which includes identification, counts, sex, and length. Additional data collected at each station includes water depth, Secchi, and a water column profile of temperature and conductivity. This data publication will include the fish, crab, gelatinous zooplankton (jellies), and water quality data. Some metadata are included for shrimp and publication of these data will follow. Metadata related to the plankton sampling will be included in the future when this data is published.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHieb, Kathy; Burns, Jillian; Soto, Kenji. 2025-10-21.
