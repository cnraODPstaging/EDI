            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1.\tCollect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2.\tAnalyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3.\tProvide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Baerwaldt, Crystal; Torres, Francheska; Niemela, Amanda; Vance, Lisa. 2025-12-11.

            "description": " Dissolved oxygen levels in the Stockton Deep Water Ship Chanel (SDWSC) have been monitored since 1968 by the Interagency Ecological Program's (IEP) Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). The SDWSC is located on the San Joaquin River near Stockton, California. Beginning in 1997, 14 stations were routinely monitored typically in summer and fall. Dissolved oxygen impairment can occur in the SDWSC; therefore, two water quality objectives were established. The objectives of the dissolved oxygen monitoring study in the SDWSC are to: (1) determine if dissolved oxygen levels comply with the water quality objectives, (2) monitor long term trends, and (3) detect and document changes along the SDWSC. The EMP collects discrete dissolved oxygen readings near the surface and bottom of the water column during ebb slack tide. The 14 stations are located between Prisoner's Point on the San Joaquin River and ends at the terminus of the channel called Turning Basin. The site locations were selected at the channel markers on the San Joaquin River; therefore, may be referred as station number or channel marker they are located at. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature were recorded 1-meter below surface and 1-meter above the bottom of the channel. Over the period of record the following water quality parameters have been added: water temperature, specific conductance, pH, fluorescence, turbidity, secchi disk and a rating score for the blue-green algae, Microcystis aeruginosa\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Lesmeister, Sarah; Rinde, Jenna. 2020-09-02.

            "description": " Condition 8 of the June 2021 Temporary Urgency Change Order for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) requires a special study of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta (Delta) and the spread of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), and floating aquatic vegetation (FAV), also referred to as \u201caquatic weeds\u201d. A report on the study was submitted to the State Water Resources Control Board on June 1, 2022. This data package contains all publicly available data used in the report, including visual cyanobacteria reports, cyanotoxin data, water quality, nutrients, flow/hydrodynamics, chlorophyll-a concentrations, temperature, coverage of SAV and FAV, use of herbicides, and human populations. Many of these data were derived from other datasets, though some were collected specifically for this study\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Rasmussen, Nicholas; Flynn, Theodore; Bouma-Gregson, Keith; Khanna, Shruti; Frantzich, Jared; Battey, Morgan; Perry, Sarah; Bashevkin, Samuel; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Perry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany; Klotz, Vivian; Khanna, Shruti; Ustin, Susan; Lay, Mui; Andrew, Margaret; Santos, Maria; Hestir, Erin; Shapiro, Kristen; Bellvert, Joaquim; Greenberg, Jonathan; Khanna, Shruti; Ustin, Susan; Bashevkin, Samuel; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth. 2023-05-03.

The raw YBFMP\u2019s water temperature data was collected by loggers\n      attached to the rotary screw trap (STTD) and Sherwood Harbor (SHR). Logger data ranged from\n      daily means (1998) to a fifteen-minute collection interval (2013-2017 for the Yolo Bypass,\n      2009-2019 for Sherwood Harbor). A daily mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and\n      coefficient of variation in water temperature was produced as well as columns for sample size\n      (n, number of measurements per day), method (data collection or estimation), category, length\n      (number of consecutive missing dates) and site. Daily water temperature data for the full\n      extent of the YBFMP\u2019s fish collection is valuable for a variety of purposes. For example,\n      variation in water temperature during inundation and comparisons between temperatures in the\n      Sacramento River and Yolo Bypass have been used as metrics of habitat complexity and linked to\n      life history diversity in salmon (Goertler et al. 2017).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoertler, Pascale ; Pien, Catarina; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Hamilton, Jasmine; Hartman, Rosemary; Nelson, Michelle; Saraceno, JohnFranco; Schreier, Brian; Davis, Brittany; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Kwan, Nicole. 2022-07-27.

            "description": " In summer 2018 we used a unique water control structure in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) to direct a managed flow pulse into Suisun Marsh, one of the largest contiguous tidal marshes on the west coast of the United States.  The action was designed to increase habitat suitability for the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a small osmerid fish endemic to the upper SFE.  The approach was to operate the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) in conjunction with increased Sacramento River tributary inflow to direct an estimated 160 x 10^6 m3 pulse of low salinity water into Suisun Marsh during August, a critical time period for juvenile Delta Smelt rearing. This dataset includes physical and biological monitoring data collected for the action. Datasets include Delta Smelt catch from the USFWS Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program, zooplankton and Microcystis abundance from the Environmental Monitoring Program, historic Delta Smelt catch from the Summer Townet Survey, Delta Outflow from the Dayflow model, extent of Delta Smelt habitat from the UnTRIM Bay-Delta model, and water quality (Salinity, Temperature, Chlorophyll, and Turibidity) collected at continuous sondes at three locations. These data are associated with the manuscript \"Evaluation of a large-scale flow manipulation to the upper San Francisco Estuary: Response of habitat conditions for an endangered native fish,\" by Dr. Ted Sommer, et al. 2020 PLOS One, in review.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Sommer, Ted; Koohafkan, Michael; Burdi, Christina; Bever, Aaron; MacWilliams, Michael; Galef, Jeff; Barros, Arthur; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Johnston, Catherine; Lee, Sunny; Mahardja, Brian; Speegle, Jonathan; Barnard, Denise; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen. 2020-07-30.

            "description": " The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) sets water quality objectives to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Bay. These objectives are met by establishing standards mandated in water right permits issued to the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation by the SWRCB. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels. In 1971, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This Decision contained new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. D-1379 was also the first water right decision to provide terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to routinely determine water quality conditions and changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. The monitoring program described in D-1379 was developed by the Stanford Research Institute through a contract with the SWRCB. Implementation of the monitoring program began in 1972, as SWRCB, DWR, and USBR met to define their individual responsibilities for various elements of the monitoring program. In 1978, amendments to water quality standards were implemented and resulted in Water Right Decision 1485 (D-1485). More recently these standards were again amended under the 1995 Water Quality Control Plan and Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) established in 1999. The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements described in D-1641. D-1641 requires DWR and USBR to conduct a comprehensive environmental monitoring program to determine compliance with the water quality standards and also to submit an annual report to SWRCB discussing data collected. The phytoplankton monitoring program is one element of DWR\u2019s and USBR\u2019s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton, and benthic organisms. The overall objective of the phytoplankton monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in phytoplankton diversity, abundance, and distribution associated with physical and other biological factors in the estuary.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are presented in this dataset. The rotary screw trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine species abundance and life stage of juvenile outmigrants and resident small-bodied fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, and (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns. The fyke trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine abundance of migrating and resident adult fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, especially with regard to anadromous species, (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns, and (4) provide data on the timing and duration of species captured in the Yolo Bypass for comparison to those captured in other Sacramento Valley tributaries. The beach seine surveys are conducted in the Yolo Bypass\u2019s perennial channel (Toe Drain), inundated floodplain, disconnected inundated ponds, and perennial ponds. The objectives of Toe Drain and inundated floodplain beach seine sampling are: (1) to examine species abundance and composition in different water year types and inundation conditions, (2) to spatially compare fish abundance and diversity in the Yolo Bypass, and (3) to estimate growth rates and densities of salmon in the Yolo Bypass versus the Sacramento River. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. Key findings include: (1) YB is a major factor regulating year class strength of splittail (Sommer et al. 1997; Feyrer et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2007a); (2) YB is a key migration corridor for adult fish of several listed species and sport fish (Harrell and Sommer 2003; Johnston et al. 2020); (3) YB is one of the most important regional rearing areas for juvenile Chinook salmon (Sommer et al. 2001a; 2005; Goertler et al. 2017, 2018; Sommer et al. 2020); (4) YB provides habitat for endangered Delta Smelt and its congeners (Mahardja et al. 2019; Davis et al. 2022), (5) and YB is a source of phytoplankton to the food web of the San Francisco Estuary (Jassby and Cloern 2000; Schemel et al. 2003; Sommer et al. 2004a; Frantzich et al. 2018).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa; Kwan, Nicole. 2025-04-08.

            "description": " To manage the critically low 2021 water supply for beneficial uses, DWR installed the temporary emergency drought barrier (EDB) on West False River in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta (Delta), approximately 5 miles south of Rio Vista, California, in Contra Costa County in June 2021. To monitor the effectiveness and impacts of the EBD, a monitoring program was initiated to track changes in hydrodynamics, water quality, fish, harmful algal blooms, and aquatic weeds in the vicinity of the EDB. The EDB was left in place during the winter of 2021-2022 and removed in fall of 2022. This data set includes all data collected as part of that monitoring program and subsets of ongoing monitoring programs that were used in the final effectiveness report for the EDB.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Huston, David; Frantzich, Jared; Salman, Tyler; Ateljevich, Eli; Clark, Kevin; Bergman, Paul; Klambach, Andrew; Wilder, Rick; Silva, Matthew; Hassrick, Jason; Hinkelman, Travis; Spaulding, Taylor; Slater, Steven; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; McKenzie, Ryan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Stagg, Jacob; Hagen, Jackie; Huber, Eric; Steinhart, Geoffrey; Arrambide, Adriana; Siddiqui, Samreen; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina. 2024-06-04. 2021-2022 West False River Emergency Drought Barrier water quality, flow, and fish monitoring ver 2.

            "description": " The Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) have the potential to increase low-salinity-zone habitat for endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus, California Endangered Species Act listed as Endangered, Federal Endangered Species Act listed as Threatened), and to allow them to more frequently occupy Suisun Marsh, especially Montezuma Slough, one of their most important rearing habitats. Operation of the SMSCG in summer and fall to improve Delta Smelt habitat are called for in the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take permit for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. To support the adaptive management of the action, the California Department of Water Resources and collaborating agencies monitored water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, clams, and fishes during the SMSCG management actions in 2018. Monitoring has continued during the summer and fall months of all subsequent years, including both those with and without actions. This data package includes data collected by the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) long-term monitoring programs supplemented with targeted sample collection where existing surveys lacked spatial or temporal coverage. Monitoring during no-action years will be used as a baseline for comparison during action years. This data package will be updated annually.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Rasmussen, Nick; Burdi, Christina; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Wells, Elizabeth; Stewart, Alan; Battey, Morgan; Nelson, Michelle; Tran, Andrew; Neumayr, Stephen; Perry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany; Klotz, Vivian; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Erly, Kate; Cook, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Bigham, Gershom; Supervisory Fish Biologist, Denise, Barnard; Senegal, Taylor. 2026-01-14.

Wireless telemetry is used to transmit real-time provisional data to the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), making the data publicly available. The published dataset is quality controlled and quality assured providing detailed information at 15-minute intervals from 18 monitoring stations, using Xylem\u2019s YSI EXO2 and YSI 6600 multiparameter sondes to document individual water quality measurements of multiple water quality parameters. The dataset informs operations for the California State Water Project and supports water quality monitoring required by Water Right Decision D-1641, the Delta Compliance Program, the South Delta Temporary Barriers and the South Delta Improvement Program. It is important to note that the start dates and subsequent equipment upgrades vary between stations and equipment leading to discrepancies in the dataset\u2019s date ranges.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFrantzich, Jared; Huynh, Elena. 2025-10-08.

Multi-year droughts are important and impactful features of California\u2019s Mediterranean climate and can fundamentally affect the water quality and the ecosystem response of the San Francisco Estuary and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This data set was assembled from data collected by long-term monitoring programs over the past 46 years (1975-2021) to evaluate how the estuary changed during multi-year droughts. Data include fish, zooplankton, jellyfish, clams, temperature, Secchi depth, and salinity as measured by fish and water quality surveys, as well as nutrients and chlorophyll measured by water quality surveys. These data are accompanied by hydrologic metrics including Delta Inflow, Delta Outflow, the position of the 2-PSU isohaline, residence time, and daily values of various continuous water quality stations located in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBosworth, David; Hartman, Rosemary; Twardochleb, Laura; Wells, Elizabeth; Bashevkin, Samuel; Sawyer, Evan; Burdi, Christina; Maguire, Amanda; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Barros, Arthur; Nelson, Peter; Flynn, Theodore; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Wells, Elizabeth; Interagency Ecological Program; Slater, Steven; Slater, Steven; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Slater, Steven; Barros, Arthur; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Hartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Rasmussen, Nicholas; Flynn, Theodore; Bouma-Gregson, Keith; Khanna, Shruti; Frantzich, Jared. 2024-06-07.

            "description": " Projected temperature increases due to global climate change are likely to have localized impacts on the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Increased water temperature in the SFE will lead to challenges for managing water resources. Many native species, such as salmon and smelt, rely on cooler water, and will be further stressed by increased water temperature, which may cause them to seek microrefugia. While several state and federal agencies in the SFE collect real-time water temperature data, most of the water temperature collection sites are at a fixed location or floating near the surface of the water column. This dataset includes four real-time water quality stations that provide water temperature data for both the surface and bottom positions in the water column. We obtained surface water temperature data from an integrated hourly water temperature dataset (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/7385985f68b02c0deb2a9e425a9f3ad8). This dataset included data downloaded from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC; https://cdec.water.ca.gov/) and cleaned with a series of quality control (QC) checks (see integrated dataset metadata).  We obtained bottom temperature data from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) internal database Water Quality Portal (WQP). Data were integrated and standardized to hourly water temperature data in degrees Celsius, and the same series of quality control (QC) checks from the surface dataset were applied in a consistent manner to all stations. Bottom temperatures were selected from surface temperatures to provide measures of temperature difference. Datasets included in this package include source hourly surface and bottom data, both obtained from DWR\u2019s WQP, as well as an integrated dataset of cleaned hourly surface and bottom data, with calculated surface-bottom temperature differences. Both datasets are filtered to the timeframe used in an analysis of surface-bottom temperature differences.  Additionally, information regarding current and historical sensors used for water temperature data collection was obtained from station managers for each station and compiled in a metadata table.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nNelson, Michelle; Pien, Catarina. 2021-12-22.

In addition to mercury, DWR collected organic carbon, total suspended sediment, chlorophyll-a, temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, turbidity, total chlorophyll, velocity, level, and flow data. To do this, three sets of data were collected: 1) velocity, level, and flow data were collected continuously using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, 2) continuous temperature, specific conductance, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and total chlorophyll were collected using a water quality sonde, and 3) THg, MeHg, organic carbon, total suspended sediment, and chlorophyll-a were collected via grab samples either by sampling pole or flow-weighted composites with an autosampler.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLee, Petra; Manning, Julianna. 2020-07-16.

            "title": "UC Davis Suisun Marsh Fish Study, CA,1980-2024",
            "description": " Suisun Marsh, at the geographic center of the northern San Francisco Estuary, provides important habitat for native and non-native fishes, as well as many valued and endangered plants, reptiles, mammals, and birds. The University of California, Davis, Suisun Marsh Fish Study, in partnership with the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), has systematically monitored the marsh's fish populations since January 1980 (O'Rear et al. 2023). The study\u2019s main purpose has been to determine natural and human-caused factors affecting fish and invertebrate distribution and abundance. All sampling has occurred in Suisun Marsh, mostly in subtidal sloughs. Sampling began in 1979, but standardized methods and stations were not implemented until 1980. Sampling has occurred monthly from January 1980 to the present at geographically fixed stations. Fixed stations have been necessary because snags preclude uninterrupted trawls in many sections of smaller sloughs. Originally, 48 stations were selected haphazardly that could be easily and safely sampled by boat and covered the breadth of Suisun Marsh to ensure capture of all variability in fish populations. However, the emphasis has been on sampling smaller sloughs because they exhibit greater variability in a smaller space than the marsh's two big sloughs (Suisun and Montezuma), and because only the big sloughs are sampled by other long-term monitoring projects such as California Fish and Wildlife's Fall Midwater Trawl. The 48 stations were sampled in 1980 and 1981. Water quality and catches were then compared across these stations to locate redundancies and thereby improve logistical efficiency while maximizing capture of variation by eliminating uninformative stations (Brown et al. 1981). Seventeen stations were then chosen and were continuously sampled from 1980 through 1993. Geographic scope was reassessed in 1994, when sampling was reinitiated in the northeast marsh in Denverton and Nurse sloughs at four stations (DV2, DV3, NS2, NS3; Figure B), in part to look for dwindling fish species [e.g., delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus)]. Catches in Nurse and Denverton sloughs were found to be unique (Matern et al. 2002); thereafter, those four stations have been included in the regular sampling, with a total of 21 stations. In 2014, to complement continuous water-quality sampling from the salinity control gates to the very top of Denverton Slough (Montgomery et al. 2016), three more stations as part of the UC Davis Arc Project were added to the 21 stations, resulting in 24 stations that are currently sampled monthly. These three additional stations (DV1, NS1, and MZ6) have also been retained because (1) they better captured gradients in water-quality conditions less discernable with the four stations (Montgomery et al. 2015), and (2) they surround areas slated for tidal restoration, increasing baseline information needed to assess restoration actions. Additionally, the transect from the MZ1 station in Montezuma Slough to the DV1 station also allows assessment of the extent of the impact of the salinity control gates (Beakes et al. 2020) in the most valuable area of the marsh for fishes (Moyle et al. 2014). Many other stations were sampled intermittently for small ancillary projects to the Suisun Marsh Fish Study. Two dedicated people - the Principal Investigator and the Supervisor - have been the primary ones paid on the study, with crews filled out with part-time staff and/or volunteers, generally graduate students but also undergraduate students, agency employees, or any other person interested in Suisun Marsh. Most supervisors have been graduate students of Peter Moyle. Most crews have consisted of three people, often four, and sometimes only two if both people are well-versed in all aspects of the sampling. Literature Cited Beakes, Michael P., Cory Graham, J.

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fisheries and invertebrate monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass since 1998. The main objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to collect baseline data on lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and insect drift), juvenile and adult fish, hydrology, and water quality parameters. As the Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by numerous regulatory agencies, these baseline data are critical for evaluating success of future restoration projects. In addition, the data have already served to increase our understanding of the role of the Yolo Bypass in the life history of native fishes, and its ecological function in the San Francisco Estuary. Zooplankton are an important component in the diet of larval, juvenile, and small adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, Striped Bass, and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects zooplankton year-round from two sites. Since 2011, samples have been collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using 150- and 50- micrometer mesh plankton nets. Zooplankton are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently BSA Environmental Services). The goals of the zooplankton monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variation in species densities and trends between (1) the Sacramento River channel, and (2) the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Data on zooplankton catch and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole. 2021-12-09.

            "title": "Monitoring juvenile Chinook salmon outmigration using rotary screw traps on the Sacramento River at Knights Landing",
            "description": " Since 1995, the rotary screw traps (RSTs) at Knights Landing have\n    provided water management agencies an early warning of emigrating\n    juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead\n    trout (O. mykiss) making their way to the Sacramento-San Joaquin\n    Delta (Delta). Due to the proximity of the site to other major\n    tributaries of the Sacramento River, such as the Feather and\n    American Rivers, it is assumed that salmonids captured at the\n    Knights Landing RSTs originate from the upper Sacramento River and\n    its tributaries, a stretch of river that provides spawning and\n    rearing habitat for all four runs of natural origin Chinook salmon:\n    winter-run (State and federally listed as endangered), spring-run\n    (State and federally listed as threatened), late fall-run and\n    fall-run, as well as steelhead trout (federally listed as\n    threatened). The near real-time information RST monitoring data provides on\n    emigration timing and relative abundance for protected runs of\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead improves the ability for\n    resource agencies and water managers to implement protective\n    measures that help them navigate through the maze of waterways in\n    the Delta. By utilizing emigration data in adaptive management,\n    reservoir releases, export rates, water transfers, and Delta Cross\n    Channel Gate operations can be modified to minimize the risk of\n    predation, entrainment, and take, thereby maximizing juvenile\n    salmonid survival through the Delta. The primary goals of the Knights Landing Monitoring Program are to\n    (1) Provide early warning of listed salmonids emigrating toward the\n    Delta, (2) Document passage of emigrating salmonids including\n    timing, relative abundance, and environmental conditions, (3)\n    Develop passage estimates of salmonids emigrating through the lower\n    Sacramento River above the Delta, and (4) Develop a long-term\n    dataset on juvenile salmonid emigration to compare changes over\n    time. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) issued ITP\n    2081-2019-066-00 to DWR on March 31, 2020, for the long-term\n    operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the Delta. Condition\n    7.5.2 of the ITP requires the development and establishment of a\n    spring-run Chinook salmon juvenile production estimate (JPE) to\n    increase understanding of the impacts water operations have on the\n    spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. Data from the Knights Landing RST will be used along\n    with other datasets from juvenile salmonid monitoring programs in\n    the Sacramento River Watershed to inform the development of JPE\n    modeling approaches. Salmonid data collected from the Knights Landing RST, among other\n    datasets, is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to\n    understand the movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed to estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon that have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time\n    operations monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2\n    of the ITP which meets weekly from October through June, to provide\n    advice for real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and\n    the Water Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBauer, Nick. 2025-12-03.

            "description": " The Enhanced Large Fish Study (ELFS) was established and included in the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) work plan in 2023 to fill some of the monitoring gap of fishes in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California. The fish monitoring of the IEP prior to ELFS primarily consisted of trawl- and seine-based surveys, which generally capture small and/or juvenile fishes due to survey gear and methodologies. In order to more effectively sample the large/adult fish portion of SFE fish communities, the ELFS uses American Fisheries Society experimental gillnets, plus the inclusion of the optional \"large fish panel,\" to sample the waters of the SFE. The experimental gillnets measure 24.4m in length, 1.8m in depth, and includes eight 3m length panels with stretch mesh measurements of 76.2mm, 114.3mm, 50.8mm, 88.9mm, 38.1mm, 127.0mm, 63.5mm, and 101.6mm. The optional large fish panel measures 9.1m by 1.8m in depth and includes three 3m length panels with stretch mesh measurements of 152.4, 177.8, and 203.2mm. The ELFS conducted its first year of sampling in the North Delta, California, in 2023, and will be expanded to the greater Delta and Suisun Bay and Marsh in future sampling years. The ELFS is currently funded as a special study to inform future monitoring, with funding contracted through fiscal year 2026-2027.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStompe, Dylan; Hobbs, James. 2023-11-01.

            "description": " The Cache Slough Complex is an ecologically significant area, with many restoration efforts of various kinds set to take place within its boundaries. These efforts which are tied to regulations set forth by the Biological Opinion, will have unknown impacts to in\u2010stream water quality. For this reason, the Department of Water Resources\u2019 Water Quality Assessment (WQA) unit developed a monitoring program to establish baseline water quality measurements to help understand the environmental impact of these restoration projects and ensure pre\u2010restoration water quality data is available to compare against post-restoration water quality. To do so, data was collected at various sites that represent all major inputs and outflows within the Cache Slough Complex from September 2013 to December 2021.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nDel Cid, Jeremy; Brown, Travis. 2024-08-07.

            "description": " CDFW issued Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) to the\n    California Department of Water Resources (DWR) on March 31, 2020,\n    for the long-term operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the\n    Sacramento San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Condition 7.5.2 of the ITP\n    requires the development and establishment of a spring-run Chinook\n    salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) juvenile production estimate (JPE)\n    to increase understanding of the impacts that water operations have\n    on the spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and to inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. As a part of the JPE effort, CDFW began operating a new rotary screw\n    trap (RST) monitoring station on the lower Feather River near River\n    Mile 17, approximately 1 mile downstream of Star Bend Park and Boat\n    Ramp near Olivehurst, in January 2022. This RST location represents\n    the lowest point in the Feather River Watershed where juvenile\n    salmon are sampled with an RST prior to entering the Sacramento\n    River and includes salmon emigrating from the Yuba River. The\n    expanded juvenile monitoring effort will help resource agencies and\n    water managers identify numbers of salmon emigrating from the\n    Feather River Watershed and contributing to the spring-run Chinook\n    salmon population entering the Delta. Monitoring is conducted annually from October through June utilizing\n    a pair of eight-foot rotary screw traps (RST). Data collected at the\n    Lower Feather River RST site provides information on the temporal\n    distribution, relative abundance, and race composition of juvenile\n    Chinook salmon; and temporal distribution and relative abundance of\n    steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the Feather River and\n    tributaries, including the Yuba River, to the Delta. Salmonid data\n    collected from the Lower Feather River RST, among other datasets, is\n    also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the\n    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to\n    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that\n    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring\n    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets\n    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time\n    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation\n    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLoera, Gabe. 2025-12-16.

            "description": " The Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s (Reclamation) Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California Department of Water Resource\u2019s (DWR) State Water Project (SWP) deliver millions of acre-feet of water annually for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and environmental needs in California from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta) through the C.W. \u201cBill\u201d Jones Pumping Plant (JPP) and Banks Pumping Plant.  Since 1957, a Reclamation operated fish salvage facility, the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF), is located upstream of the JPP and functions to salvage fish entrained in exported water (Bates and Vinsonhaler 1957).  Additionally, the John E. Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility (SDFPF) was added by the California Department of Water Resources in 1968 to salvage fishes diverted by the SWP.  The salvage process involves fish collection, counting, handling and transportation back to the Delta.  To prevent fish loss, CVP and SWP fish facilities were constructed at Old river, where fish are diverted to the fish facilities for counting and reporting.  After counting, the fish are collected in storage tanks and taken to several release locations in the Delta via fish-haul tank trucks.  Millions of fishes from 69 species are salvaged through this process by the two fish facilities.  Data collected includes species collected, fish lengths, water flow, export amounts, and water quality.  Fishes listed (Endangered Species Act (ESA) or California Endangered Species Act (CESA)) were Chinook Salmon, Delta Smelt, steelhead trout, Longfin Smelt, and Green Sturgeon.  The California Department of Fish and Wildlife monitors fish salvage and manages the data collected from the fish facilities in addition to data collected and managed by DWR and Reclamation.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAfentoulis, Virginia; Siddiqui, Samreen; Aasen, Geir; Griffiths, Walter; Malinich, Timothy; Damon, Lauren; Aasen, Geir; Aasen, Geir; Morinaka, Jerry; Reyes, Rene. 2025-07-11.

            "description": " Phytoplankton community composition is an important driver of zooplankton productivity and food supply for higher trophic levels in the San Francisco Estuary. Various monitoring surveys throughout the region collect phytoplankton enumeration data dating back to the 1990s. These include surveys from the CA Department of Water Resources (CADWR), CA Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and the US Geological Survey (USGS). These surveys collect data via various sampling and laboratory methods which are not always directly comparable. This integrated dataset includes both enumeration counts and well-documented metadata to allow for informed decision-making in the integration of these data. It also standardizes taxonomic names between groups via a key list. Note that, in this dataset, we make conservative decisions about taxonomic resolution to ensure maximum compatibility between groups. For more detailed metadata and higher taxonomic resolution, refer to individual surveys\u2019 publications or reach out to their primary contact.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPerry, Sarah; Brown, Tiffany. 2025-11-13.

The USFWS Lodi Field Office, in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey, developed the survey in 2018 to expand fish monitoring and inferences in nearshore habitats not monitored by long-term USFWS beach seine surveys within the San Francisco Estuary. The survey uses a robust statistical framework, including a stratified random sampling design and segmented transects that act as spatial replicates for occupancy modeling.

            "title": "Directed Outflow Project Lower Trophic Study",
            "description": " The upper San Francisco Bay Estuary and Sacramento San Joaquin Delta is critical habitat for the endemic Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered planktivorous fish with an annual, semi-anadromous life cycle. Freshwater outflow actions during the fall season are hypothesized to improve Delta Smelt habitat and therefore Delta Smelt condition before the spawning life stage. As part of efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of such actions to benefit Delta Smelt populations, various studies were initiated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation under the Directed Outflow Project (DOP). One component of the DOP was to evaluate how the Fall X2 freshwater outflow action changed the lower trophic prey available to Delta Smelt. The action is hypothesized to change abiotic and biotic aspects that can benefit Delta Smelt habitat by using freshwater outflow to maintain the position of X2 (defined as the distance in kilometers from the Golden Gate Bridge to the tidally averaged 2 ppt salinity isohaline) at around 70 km during wet or above normal precipitation water years. This moves the low salinity zone (0.5 - 6 ppt) further seaward into Suisun Bay which increases the area of preferred Delta Smelt habitat. Field sampling began the September of 2017 and occurred bi-weekly through the end of November, paired with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program. Three random sites were sampled per target region (Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, the Lower Sacramento River, the Cache Slough Complex, and the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel) per week. Sites were chosen using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified design. During 2018, sampling was increased to weekly and in 2019-2020 sampling began in April and ended in November. Sampling occurs for three different habitat types: shoal, channel surface and channel deep at each site depending on the depth of the water column. The shoal habitat is less than 10 feet, channel habitat is greater than 10 feet and channel deep habitat is greater than 20 feet. Plankton nets are towed approximately 0.5-meters below the surface in shoal and channel habitats and targeting the lower half to lower third of the water column in channel deep habitats. Two size classes of zooplankton are targeted using a pair of nets with different mesh sizes: mesozooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with a 150 micrometer mesh net and macrozooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with a 500 micrometer mesh net. Before each zooplankton tow water quality variables (temperature, dissolve oxygen, turbidity, specific conductivity, salinity, pH, and chlorophyll-a) are measured using a YSI EXO 2 sonde, 1 meter below the surface for channel surface and shoal habitats or at the target tow depth for channel deep habitats. Alongside zooplankton tows, phytoplankton samples are taken from a water sample and preserved in a Lugol's solution. In addition, whole water samples are filtered for nutrient (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and dissolved organic carbon) and chlorophyll-a analysis. These samples are only taken at the channel surface and shoal habitats. This dataset has been used in numerous manuscripts, reports, and technical reports to examine the state of the lower trophic food web in the context of available food for Delta Smelt.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSchultz, Andrew; Kalmbach, Andrew. 2023-05-15.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program's Smelt Larva Survey was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in 2009 to monitor the distribution and abundance of newly hatched Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) in the San Francisco Estuary. Surveys are conducted bi-weekly, and sampling begins in December and continues through mid-March. The SLS samples at fixed stations, from San Pablo Bay through Suisun Bay and into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Napa River stations were added in 2014 and the San Pablo Bay expansion stations were added in December 2022. Each sampling week currently consists of 59 stations. At each station, one 10-minute stepped oblique (bottom to top) tow is conducted following a prescribed tow schedule. The net is a conical 500 \u00b5m mesh lashed to a D-shaped frame mounted on skis. Larval fish samples are preserved in the field in 10% formalin and brought back to the CDFW Stockton Lab for identification and enumeration under a microscope. Several types of data are collected at each station in addition to the larval fish sample, including the volume of water sampled by the net, surface water temperature, surface and bottom specific conductance (EC normalized at 25\u02daC), Secchi disk depth, tow duration, tidal condition, and surface water turbidity.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBrennan, Colin; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica. 2025-09-11.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

In-lake monitoring (in-situ measurements) is needed to understand better the processes contributing to poor water quality. This data package contains the in-situ measurements collected by the University of California, Davis at Clear Lake between 2019 and 2023, which include: continous stream properties at three locations (Middle, Scott, and Kelsey Creeks); continuous meteorological variables at seven locations around the perimeter of the lake; continuous lake temperature and dissolved oxygen at multiple depths and locations across the lake (six permanent water quality stations); continuous lake surface temperature in the shoreline; and discreate samples to measure nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biovolumes and species identification throughout the water column and across all three lake basins every 6-8 weeks.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCort\u00e9s, Alicia; Schladow, Samuel; Forrest, Alexander; Sadro, Steven. 2025-06-27.

            "description": " The Fish Restoration Program Monitoring Team assesses the biological effectiveness of 8,000+ acres of tidal wetland restoration in the Upper San Francisco Estuary (Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh) through a contract with the CA Department of Water Resources. The restoration is pursuant to requirements in the 2008/2009 and 2019 Biological Opinions for state and federal water project operations. Data on fish and invertebrate abundance on or near these sites was collected as baseline monitoring data and to determine the most efficient methods for monitoring wetlands. Understanding how invertebrate, fish, and phytoplankton communities change pre- to post-restoration is essential to evaluating the benefits of tidal wetlands to native fish species. Invertebrate data was collected using sweep nets, benthic cores, neuston nets, and zooplankton trawls. Fish data was collected using otter trawls, lampara nets, and beach seines. For each method, the team recorded the catch of fish, invertebrates, and other organisms, length of selected organisms, and a suite of environmental information, including: dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, and dissolved organic carbon. Additional water quality samples, processed for Chlorophyll a, Dissolved Ammonia, Dissolved Nitrite + Nitrate, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Dissolved Organic Nitrogen, Dissolved Ortho-phosphate, Pheophytin a, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Total Organic Carbon, Total Phosphorus, and Total Suspended Solids, were collected at a subset of sampling sites. Data are collected before and after restoration at project and reference sites (Before-After-Control-Impact-design), as well as at adjacent water bodies.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBowles, Christy; Sherman, Stacy; Avila, Michelle; Cox, Daniel; Murray, Emma; Chavez, Amanda; Dungey, Darian; Ng, Gabriel; Hartman, Rosemary; Ellis, Daniel; Contreras, Dave. 2025-04-30.

            "description": " The objective of this study was to assess the relative distributions\n  of non-native resident fishes occurring in littoral habitats during\n  the drought year of 2014 within the western and northern portion of\n  California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), USA. A number of\n  non-native resident fish species (e.g., black bass, Micropterus spp.)\n  in the Delta have undergone remarkable increases in density in the\n  early 2000s and they are potential predators of endangered native\n  fishes such as Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Delta\n  Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The Delta makes up the tidal\n  freshwater portion of the San Francisco Estuary in California;\n  however, the critically dry year of 2014 caused a considerable\n  intrusion of salinity field within this region and may have caused a\n  shift in the resident fish community. To evaluate the response of\n  non-native resident fishes to this salinity intrusion, a boat\n  electrofishing survey was conducted in November of 2014 in the western\n  and northern part of the Delta by the United States Fish and Wildlife\n  Service, Lodi, California Office as part of the Interagency Ecological\n  Program for the San Francisco Estuary. Replicate sampling was done for\n  each site in this study in order to account for false zeroes through\n  the estimation of capture probability.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; Kirsch, Joseph; Mahardja, Brian. 2019-10-23.

From 2018 to 2019, four different sampling methods (Beach Seine, Manta Trawl Net, 20-mm Surface Trawl Net, 20-mm Midwater Trawl Net) nested in time and space were used to estimate the occupancy rate, relative density, and size distribution of larval Delta Smelt across sampling methods and water depth strata within the San Francisco Estuary.

            "description": " The objective of our study is to better understand the factors affecting chlorophyll-a production within a floodplain and its transport downstream to determine how lateral connectivity influences longitudinal connectivity.  The Yolo Bypass is an engineered floodplain of the Sacramento River that inundates during periods of high outflow via overtopping weirs. Water traveling through the Yolo Bypass flows parallel to the Sacramento River and re-connects to the mainstem at the southern extent of the floodplain. Several monitoring programs in the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta and Yolo Bypass collect discrete and continuous water quality data, including chlorophyll measurements. For this study, we synthesized available flow, water temperature, chlorophyll and inundation data between March 1999 to December 2019 and modeled the effects of environmental variables and inundation on chlorophyll-a production in the floodplain, the mainstem, and downstream of the floodplain/mainstem.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPien, Catarina; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Goertler, Pascale; Peek, Ryan; Chapple, Dylan; Yamane, Lauren; Berglund, Mattea; Khanna, Shruti; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Adams, Jesse; Pien, Catarina; Goertler, Pascale ; Pien, Catarina; Goertler, Pascale ; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Ruhl, Catherine; Cheng, Robin. 2023-12-13.

            "description": " The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Lodi Fish and Wildlife Office (LFWO) Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has intermittently sampled Liberty Island with various equipment since 2002. Liberty Island was a reclaimed agricultural island until it flooded in 1997-1998 and we subsequently left to passively restore as a tidally influenced wetland. Larval trawls and beach were the only sampling methods used during both early (2002-2005) and late (2009-2019) sampling periods. The main purpose of the sampling was to gather information about fish presence and abundance in Liberty Island during the passive restoration, with an emphasis on reproductive and early life-stages of native species. Larval trawls, or tow nets, were used to catch larval fish in 2004-2005 and again from 2013-2019. Zooplankton nets were used 2013-2019. Water quality measurements were collected alongside each tow.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGilbert, Morgan; Smith, Lori; Steinhart, Geoff. 2023-12-11.

            "description": " The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. DATA CORRECTION/UPDATE: Previous data versions 244.6, 244.7, and 244.8 contained an error and resulted in duplicated records of hatchery Chinook Salmon in the datasets. These datasets were removed from the data repository and the error was corrected in version 244.9 and after.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Summer Townet Survey (STN) and Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) are two long-term monitoring projects conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to monitor fish abundance and distribution trends in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) since 1959 and 1967, respectively. Starting in 2005, zooplankton monitoring was added and paired with fish tows to investigate food availability for young fishes. Food limitation has been a long-term issue and a focus of the Pelagic Organism Decline (POD) studies that began in 2005. By 2011, STN routinely conducted zooplankton monitoring at 40 stations, and FMWT at 32 stations in the upper SFE from Carquinez Strait to the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel and into the South Delta. STN samples every other week from June to August and FMWT samples once monthly from September to December. Both projects collect mesozooplankton samples using a modified Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net to target copepods and cladocerans, and FMWT also samples macrozooplankton (i.e. mysids and amphipods) using a mysid net. Flowmeters are used to measure the volume sampled to determine zooplankton catch per unit effort. Environmental variables such as water temperature, turbidity, secchi, and electrical conductivity are collected with each zooplankton sample. Concurrent fish and zooplankton tows conducted by STN and FMWT have allowed for comparisons of fish diet to the available zooplankton prey at the time of collection.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBreining-Aday, Spencer; Slater, Steven; Burdi, Christina. 2025-01-02.

            "description": " The San Francisco Bay Study (Bay Study) was established in 1980 to determine the effects of freshwater outflow on the abundance and distribution of fish and mobile crustaceans (bracyuran crabs and caridean shrimp) in the San Francisco Estuary, mainly downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Bay Study survey currently samples 52 open-water stations monthly from a research vessel with two types of trawl gear: a midwater trawl to sample pelagic fishes, and an otter trawl to sample demersal fishes, crabs, and shrimp. Historically, the study also included plankton sampling (1980-1989) for larval fish and crustaceans. Fish collected by the otter and midwater trawl are identified to species, counted, and a representative subsample is measured.  In addition, crabs from the otter trawl are identified, counted, sexed, and measured, and gelatinous zooplankton from the midwater trawl are identified and counted. Shrimp are retained from each otter trawl sample and returned to the laboratory for processing, which includes identification, counts, sex, and length. Additional data collected at each station includes water depth, Secchi, and a water column profile of temperature and conductivity. This data publication will include the fish, crab, gelatinous zooplankton (jellies), and water quality data. Some metadata are included for shrimp and publication of these data will follow. Metadata related to the plankton sampling will be included in the future when this data is published.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHieb, Kathy; Burns, Jillian; Soto, Kenji. 2025-10-21.

            "description": " The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) is simultaneously a central hub of\n    water delivery in California and home to commercially important and\n    endangered fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, Green Sturgeon, and Delta\n    and Longfin Smelt. Extensive ecological monitoring has been\n    conducted for over 50 years, mainly under the auspices of the\n    Interagency Ecological Program for the San Francisco Estuary\n    (https://iep.ca.gov/). We integrated fish catch and length data from\n    10 long-term monitoring surveys in the SFE. The integrated database\n    contains survey-level data such as environmental variables and\n    sampling effort in addition to the fish-level species, lengths, and\n    counts. Zero catches have been filled in for any species not caught\n    in a sample. The geographic scope includes San Francisco Bay through\n    the upper estuary, and the timeseries spans 1959 to 2024. Sampling\n    methods, gear, fish length metric, and other factors differ among\n    the component surveys. Sampling designs (locations and temporal\n    frequency) have also changed over time. Thus, it is highly\n    recommended to inspect the documentation of the component surveys\n    for more information on their methods.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBashevkin, Samuel; Nguyen, Trinh; Tham, Enoch; Gaeta, Jereme; Mitchell, Lara; Khanna, Shruti; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Stagg, Jacob; McKenzie, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Arrambide, Adriana; Huber, Eric; Marcetti, Donald; Steinhart, Geoffrey; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Erly, Kate; Cook, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Bigham, Gershom; Supervisory Fish Biologist, Denise, Goodman; Senegal, Taylor; Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Siddiqui, Samreen; Assen, Geir; Afentoulis, Virginia; Griffiths, Walter; Damon, Lauren; CDFW; Teejay, O'Rear; John, Durand; Peter, Moyle; CDFW; CDFW. 2024-08-02.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Summer Townet Survey (STN) is a long-term effort to monitor the annual recruitment success of young pelagic fishes in the upper San Francisco Estuary (California, United States). Conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) since 1959, STN has sampled fixed locations from Eastern San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista on the Sacramento River, and to Stockton on the San Joaquin River; and a single station in the lower Napa River. The study area was expanded in 2011 to include the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (SDWSC) and Cache Slough (CS). Currently, 40 stations are sampled as a \u201csurvey\u201d every other week June through August for 6 surveys. A conical net, lashed to a fixed metal \u201cD\u201d frame, is pulled obliquely through the water column 2 to 3 times at each station. All fish and macro-invertebrates are identified and enumerated from each tow, with fork lengths (mm) of the first 50 of each fish species also recorded. Fish catch, length-frequency, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) among stations is available with data visualization tools on the study website for all species (https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey). Data collected at historic 31 stations are used to calculate annual relative abundance indices for age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The remaining 9 stations are sampled to expand our sampling range further upriver and increase our understanding of larval and juvenile fish abundance and distribution in the lower Napa River and the North Delta. A meso-zooplankton net targeting copepods and cladocerans is also used in parallel to assess fish food resources at each station and a subset of the fish collected are retained for diet analysis by CDFW researchers (beginning 2005, see STN and FMWT zooplankton data on EDI). The STN also measures habitat conditions via water temperature (\u00b0C), water clarity (Secchi disk depth in cm), Turbidity (NTU) and specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm). Historically, STN began in response to the development of Central Valley Project pumping plants exporting water from the South Delta. STN continues to monitor fish abundance and distribution in relation to water diversions, for the operation of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, and management flow actions to improve summer-fall habitat conditions. Managers and researchers use the data collected by STN to inform decisions and improve our understanding of the health of the upper San Francisco Estuary.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nJohnson, Margaret; Rohlin, Taylor; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Ugbah, Nene; Rocha, Allegra; Slater, Steven; Malinich, Timothy; White, James; Burdi, Christina. 2025-10-08.
