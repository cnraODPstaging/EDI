            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) was initiated in compliance with the Water Right Decision D-1379 (now mandated by Water Right Decision D-1641) and has monitored benthic invertebrate macrofauna in the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE) since 1975. The objectives of the EMP are to obtain consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring stations and to report this information for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary. While the EMP also collects discrete and continuous water quality data, along with phytoplankton and zooplankton data, this dataset only includes the benthic invertebrate data collected by the EMP from 1975-2024. EMP monitors invertebrate communities in the benthos of the SFE by collecting dredge samples with a Ponar sampler. Sediment and particles smaller than 0.5mm are removed from the sample using a sieve table. The invertebrates present are preserved in formalin, identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level, and enumerated. Currently, samples are collected monthly at 10 sites across the range of salinities found in the SFE. Four replicate dredge samples are collected at each site. The frequency of sampling, number and identity of sampling sites, and number of replicate samples has changed through the 45+ years of monitoring effort, in response to changes in perceived need for data. Links to other EMP datasets can be found on the EMP website: https://emp-des.github.io/emp-reports/data-links.html, or can be found on EDI for searching for \"Environmental Monitoring Program\" and \"San Francisco\".\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nWells, Elizabeth; Interagency Ecological Program. 2025-06-17.

            "description": " Dissolved oxygen levels in the Stockton Deep Water Ship Chanel (SDWSC) have been monitored since 1968 by the Interagency Ecological Program's (IEP) Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). The SDWSC is located on the San Joaquin River near Stockton, California. Beginning in 1997, 14 stations were routinely monitored typically in summer and fall. Dissolved oxygen impairment can occur in the SDWSC; therefore, two water quality objectives were established. The objectives of the dissolved oxygen monitoring study in the SDWSC are to: (1) determine if dissolved oxygen levels comply with the water quality objectives, (2) monitor long term trends, and (3) detect and document changes along the SDWSC. The EMP collects discrete dissolved oxygen readings near the surface and bottom of the water column during ebb slack tide. The 14 stations are located between Prisoner's Point on the San Joaquin River and ends at the terminus of the channel called Turning Basin. The site locations were selected at the channel markers on the San Joaquin River; therefore, may be referred as station number or channel marker they are located at. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature were recorded 1-meter below surface and 1-meter above the bottom of the channel. Over the period of record the following water quality parameters have been added: water temperature, specific conductance, pH, fluorescence, turbidity, secchi disk and a rating score for the blue-green algae, Microcystis aeruginosa\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Lesmeister, Sarah; Rinde, Jenna. 2020-09-02.

            "description": " In summer 2018 we used a unique water control structure in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) to direct a managed flow pulse into Suisun Marsh, one of the largest contiguous tidal marshes on the west coast of the United States.  The action was designed to increase habitat suitability for the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a small osmerid fish endemic to the upper SFE.  The approach was to operate the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) in conjunction with increased Sacramento River tributary inflow to direct an estimated 160 x 10^6 m3 pulse of low salinity water into Suisun Marsh during August, a critical time period for juvenile Delta Smelt rearing. This dataset includes physical and biological monitoring data collected for the action. Datasets include Delta Smelt catch from the USFWS Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program, zooplankton and Microcystis abundance from the Environmental Monitoring Program, historic Delta Smelt catch from the Summer Townet Survey, Delta Outflow from the Dayflow model, extent of Delta Smelt habitat from the UnTRIM Bay-Delta model, and water quality (Salinity, Temperature, Chlorophyll, and Turibidity) collected at continuous sondes at three locations. These data are associated with the manuscript \"Evaluation of a large-scale flow manipulation to the upper San Francisco Estuary: Response of habitat conditions for an endangered native fish,\" by Dr. Ted Sommer, et al. 2020 PLOS One, in review.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Sommer, Ted; Koohafkan, Michael; Burdi, Christina; Bever, Aaron; MacWilliams, Michael; Galef, Jeff; Barros, Arthur; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Johnston, Catherine; Lee, Sunny; Mahardja, Brian; Speegle, Jonathan; Barnard, Denise; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen. 2020-07-30.

            "description": "Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP\u2019s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir. Stage height is the water level of the river. Fremont Weir is upstream of the Yolo Bypass and when Fremont Weir overtops, or reaches its monitoring stage, the Yolo Bypass is considered inundated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa. 2023-12-19.

The raw YBFMP\u2019s water temperature data was collected by loggers\n      attached to the rotary screw trap (STTD) and Sherwood Harbor (SHR). Logger data ranged from\n      daily means (1998) to a fifteen-minute collection interval (2013-2017 for the Yolo Bypass,\n      2009-2019 for Sherwood Harbor). A daily mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and\n      coefficient of variation in water temperature was produced as well as columns for sample size\n      (n, number of measurements per day), method (data collection or estimation), category, length\n      (number of consecutive missing dates) and site. Daily water temperature data for the full\n      extent of the YBFMP\u2019s fish collection is valuable for a variety of purposes. For example,\n      variation in water temperature during inundation and comparisons between temperatures in the\n      Sacramento River and Yolo Bypass have been used as metrics of habitat complexity and linked to\n      life history diversity in salmon (Goertler et al. 2017).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoertler, Pascale ; Pien, Catarina; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Hamilton, Jasmine; Hartman, Rosemary; Nelson, Michelle; Saraceno, JohnFranco; Schreier, Brian; Davis, Brittany; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Kwan, Nicole. 2022-07-27.

Extensive ecological\n    monitoring has been conducted for over 50 years, mainly under the\n    auspices of the Interagency Ecological Program for the San Francisco\n    Estuary (https://iep.ca.gov/). We integrated water quality data from\n    16 boat-based long-term monitoring surveys in the upper SFE.

            "description": " The Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. Program objectives include: Collecting baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance; Analyzing and communicating Yolo Bypass data with stakeholders and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management related questions; Providing technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. We collect discrete water quality data using a YSI ProDSS and sample phytoplankton, chlorophyll and nutrients as discrete water grabs taken biweekly (or weekly during Yolo Bypass inundation) along with lower trophic tows. Water is sampled at three sites along the Yolo Bypass and Sacramento River, then processed and analyzed by an internal DWR laboratory.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Adams, Jesse; Pien, Catarina. 2023-04-11.

            "description": " The Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) have the potential to increase low-salinity-zone habitat for endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus, California Endangered Species Act listed as Endangered, Federal Endangered Species Act listed as Threatened), and to allow them to more frequently occupy Suisun Marsh, especially Montezuma Slough, one of their most important rearing habitats. Operation of the SMSCG in summer and fall to improve Delta Smelt habitat are called for in the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take permit for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. To support the adaptive management of the action, the California Department of Water Resources and collaborating agencies monitored water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, clams, and fishes during the SMSCG management action in 2018 and subsequent summer and fall months of non-action years (2019-2022). This data package includes data collected by the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) long-term monitoring programs supplemented with targeted sample collection where existing surveys lacked spatial or temporal coverage. Monitoring during no-action years will be used as a baseline for comparison during action years.

In addition to mercury, DWR collected organic carbon, total suspended sediment, chlorophyll-a, temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, turbidity, total chlorophyll, velocity, level, and flow data. To do this, three sets of data were collected: 1) velocity, level, and flow data were collected continuously using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, 2) continuous temperature, specific conductance, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and total chlorophyll were collected using a water quality sonde, and 3) THg, MeHg, organic carbon, total suspended sediment, and chlorophyll-a were collected via grab samples either by sampling pole or flow-weighted composites with an autosampler.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLee, Petra; Manning, Julianna. 2020-07-16.

            "description": " To manage the critically low 2021 water supply for beneficial uses, DWR installed the temporary emergency drought barrier (EDB) on West False River in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta (Delta), approximately 5 miles south of Rio Vista, California, in Contra Costa County in June 2021. To monitor the effectiveness and impacts of the EBD, a monitoring program was initiated to track changes in hydrodynamics, water quality, fish, harmful algal blooms, and aquatic weeds in the vicinity of the EDB. The EDB was left in place during the winter of 2021-2022 and removed in fall of 2022. This data set includes all data collected as part of that monitoring program and subsets of ongoing monitoring programs that were used in the final effectiveness report for the EDB.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Huston, David; Frantzich, Jared; Salman, Tyler; Ateljevich, Eli; Clark, Kevin; Bergman, Paul; Klambach, Andrew; Wilder, Rick; Silva, Matthew; Hassrick, Jason; Hinkelman, Travis; Spaulding, Taylor; Slater, Steven; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; McKenzie, Ryan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Stagg, Jacob; Hagen, Jackie; Huber, Eric; Steinhart, Geoffrey; Arrambide, Adriana; Siddiqui, Samreen; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina. 2024-06-04. 2021-2022 West False River Emergency Drought Barrier water quality, flow, and fish monitoring ver 2.

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Drift invertebrate and ichthyoplankton catch and water quality from the Sacramento River channel, and Sacramento River floodplain and tidal slough, collected by the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program, 1998-2022",
            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. Aquatic and terrestrial insects are an important component in the diet of juvenile and adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including two important native fishes: juvenile Chinook Salmon and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects drift invertebrates year-round from two sites. Currently, samples are collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using a rectangular aquatic drift net that sits at the surface of the water. Invertebrates are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc.). The goals of the monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends of aquatic and terrestrial insects/non-insects within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Drift invertebrate Key findings to date include: (1) Chinook Salmon sampled in the floodplain had diets comprised of 90% Dipterans and zooplankton, with Chironomidae being the dominant Diptera family (Sommer et al., 2001), (2) The floodplain of the Yolo Bypass contains significantly higher densities of Diptera (Diptera densities being positively associated with flow) and terrestrial invertebrates than the adjacent Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2001b: Sommer et al. 2004: Sommer et al. 2007), (3) A major portion of the diet of juvenile Sacramento Splittail are chironomid larvae (Kurth and Nobriga 2001, Moyle et al. 2004, Sommer et al. 2007), and (4) The Yolo Bypass was the site of the discovery of a new aestivating and winter emerging chironomid; Hydrobaenus saetheri (Cranston et al. 2007). The collection of ichthyoplankton is one of multiple elements of the YBFMP. Currently, the YBFMP collects ichthyoplankton in the Yolo Bypass from January to July. Historically, ichthyoplankton were also sampled in the Sacramento River, but due to low catch, this was stopped in 2019. Sampling is conducted with a 500-micron mesh conical plankton net. Fish are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc). The initial goal of ichthyoplankton monitoring was to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends within the Sacramento River channel and the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain (Sommer et al. 2003). The collection of ichthyoplankton samples is an important element in determining the annual presence, timing, and recruitment success of fishes utilizing the Yolo Bypass. Data on ichthyoplankton and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset. Key findings to date include: (1) 26 species of fish larvae were observed in the Yolo Bypass during the 20-years of monitoring (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data), including Delta Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus (Sommer et al 2004); (2) The native Prickly Sculpin and non-native Threadfin Shad dominated samples, contributing to over 60% of the total larval catch (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (3) Native species made up a higher percent of total catch in the Yolo Bypass (22.43%) in comparison to in the Sacramento River (10.2%), and appeared earlier in the year than many non-natives (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (4) Similar to other seasonal floodplains in the San Francisco Estuary, alien fishes made up a large portion of the assemblage of early life stages in the Yolo Bypass (Sommer et al 2004); (5) Water temperature and stage are the best explanatory environmental variables for larval fish abundance in the Yolo Bypass (p=0.001). Flow was not statistically significant (Mollie Ogaz and J. Frantzich, DWR, unpublished data); (6) Species richness and diversity are higher in the Yolo bypass in comparison to in the Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2004).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa. 2024-12-11.

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: 1. Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with interested parties and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods. The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are presented in this dataset. The rotary screw trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine species abundance and life stage of juvenile outmigrants and resident small-bodied fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, and (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns. The fyke trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine abundance of migrating and resident adult fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, especially with regard to anadromous species, (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns, and (4) provide data on the timing and duration of species captured in the Yolo Bypass for comparison to those captured in other Sacramento Valley tributaries. The beach seine surveys are conducted in the Yolo Bypass\u2019s perennial channel (Toe Drain), inundated floodplain, disconnected inundated ponds, and perennial ponds. The objectives of Toe Drain and inundated floodplain beach seine sampling are: (1) to examine species abundance and composition in different water year types and inundation conditions, (2) to spatially compare fish abundance and diversity in the Yolo Bypass, and (3) to estimate growth rates and densities of salmon in the Yolo Bypass versus the Sacramento River. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. Key findings include: (1) YB is a major factor regulating year class strength of splittail (Sommer et al. 1997; Feyrer et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2007a); (2) YB is a key migration corridor for adult fish of several listed species and sport fish (Harrell and Sommer 2003; Johnston et al. 2020); (3) YB is one of the most important regional rearing areas for juvenile Chinook salmon (Sommer et al. 2001a; 2005; Goertler et al. 2017, 2018; Sommer et al. 2020); (4) YB provides habitat for endangered Delta Smelt and its congeners (Mahardja et al. 2019; Davis et al. 2022), (5) and YB is a source of phytoplankton to the food web of the San Francisco Estuary (Jassby and Cloern 2000; Schemel et al. 2003; Sommer et al. 2004a; Frantzich et al. 2018).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Vance, Lisa; Kwan, Nicole. 2025-04-08.

Multi-year droughts are important and impactful features of California\u2019s Mediterranean climate and can fundamentally affect the water quality and the ecosystem response of the San Francisco Estuary and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This data set was assembled from data collected by long-term monitoring programs over the past 46 years (1975-2021) to evaluate how the estuary changed during multi-year droughts. Data include fish, zooplankton, jellyfish, clams, temperature, Secchi depth, and salinity as measured by fish and water quality surveys, as well as nutrients and chlorophyll measured by water quality surveys. These data are accompanied by hydrologic metrics including Delta Inflow, Delta Outflow, the position of the 2-PSU isohaline, residence time, and daily values of various continuous water quality stations located in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBosworth, David; Hartman, Rosemary; Twardochleb, Laura; Wells, Elizabeth; Bashevkin, Samuel; Sawyer, Evan; Burdi, Christina; Maguire, Amanda; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Barros, Arthur; Nelson, Peter; Flynn, Theodore; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Wells, Elizabeth; Interagency Ecological Program; Slater, Steven; Slater, Steven; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Slater, Steven; Barros, Arthur; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Hartman, Rosemary; Bosworth, David; Rasmussen, Nicholas; Flynn, Theodore; Bouma-Gregson, Keith; Khanna, Shruti; Frantzich, Jared. 2024-06-07.

The objectives of the EMP are to obtain consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring stations, provide and document information necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards, and to report this information for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary. While the EMP also collects biological data, this dataset only includes the discrete water quality and nutrient data collected by the EMP from 1975-2021.

            "description": "Hydrology is one of the major disturbance regimes thought to shape aquatic habitat.\n      However, the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) has been altered by urban and agricultural\n      development. Approximately 95% of the estuary\u2019s wetlands have been diked, channelization is\n      pervasive, and the biological community and water quality have been changed by exotic species\n      introductions, sediment inputs from mining, and pollution from agricultural and urban\n      chemicals. The hydrography has also been altered by upstream dams, which reduce the magnitude\n      of both winter precipitation pulses and spring snow melt pulses when filling reservoirs. In\n      addition to reservoir storage, 35% to 65% of tributary inflow is diverted by large water\n      diversions, as well as thousands of smaller agricultural pumps and siphons. Nevertheless, the\n      SFE retains a substantial area of seasonal off-channel habitat in the Sacramento River, the\n      Yolo Bypass. The Yolo Bypass is hydraulically dynamic and is strongly influenced by tides\n      during low discharge periods and dominated by fluvial river dynamics during flood events. This\n      river floodplain-tidal slough complex is, therefore, much more hydrodynamically variable than\n      the adjacent mainstem Sacramento River channel and benefits from additional metrics than those\n      typically measured for river systems. These data are the modeled duration of inundation in the\n      Yolo Bypass, which was approximated as the number of days in which Yolo Bypass flow was\n      greater than 113.27 m3/s following an inundation event from the Sacramento River (e.g., when\n      the stage height of the Sacramento River exceeded the height of the Fremont Weir, 10.2\n      meters). Inundation in the Yolo Bypass creates a complex transition zone between the river\n      floodplain and tidal slough habitat, which likely represents the historically dominant habitat\n      in the North Delta. Therefore, inundation brings many advantages for native fish, such as\n      increased growth opportunities on the floodplain, an alternative route into the estuary, and\n      an expansion and diversification of rearing habitat. This definition for inundation duration\n      was developed in Goertler et al. 2017.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoertler, Pascale . 2022-07-26. Modeled daily Yolo Bypass inundation ver 1.

            "description": " Few paired lake-watershed studies examine long term effects of climate\n  on the ecosystem function of lakes in a hydrological context. We use\n  thirty-two years of hydrological and biogeochemical data from a\n  high-elevation site in the Sierra Nevada of California to characterize\n  variation in snowmelt in relation to climate variability, and explore\n  the impact on factors affecting phytoplankton biomass. The magnitude\n  of accumulated winter snow, quantified through basin-wide estimates of\n  snow water equivalent (SWE), was the most important climate factor\n  controlling variation in the timing and rate of spring snowmelt.\n  Variations in SWE and snowmelt led to significant differences in lake\n  flushing rate, water temperature, and nitrate concentrations across\n  years. On average in dry years, snowmelt started 25 days earlier and\n  proceeded 7 mm/d slower, and the lake began the ice-free season with\n  nitrate concentrations ~2 uM higher and water temperatures 9 C warmer\n  than in wet years. Flushing rates in wet years were 2.5 times larger\n  than dry years. Consequently, particulate organic matter\n  concentrations, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, were 5 \u2013 6 uM\n  higher in dry years. There was a temporal trend of increase in\n  particulate organic matter across dry years that corresponded to lake\n  warming independent of variation in SWE. These results suggest that\n  phytoplankton biomass is increasing as a result of both interannual\n  variability in precipitation and long term warming trends. Our study\n  underscores the need to account for local-scale catchment variability\n  that may affect the accumulation of winter snowpack when predicting\n  climate responses in lakes.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSadro, Steve. 2018-04-19.

            "description": " Projected temperature increases due to global climate change are likely to have localized impacts on the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Increased water temperature in the SFE will lead to challenges for managing water resources. Many native species, such as salmon and smelt, rely on cooler water, and will be further stressed by increased water temperature, which may cause them to seek microrefugia. While several state and federal agencies in the SFE collect real-time water temperature data, most of the water temperature collection sites are at a fixed location or floating near the surface of the water column. This dataset includes four real-time water quality stations that provide water temperature data for both the surface and bottom positions in the water column. We obtained surface water temperature data from an integrated hourly water temperature dataset (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/7385985f68b02c0deb2a9e425a9f3ad8). This dataset included data downloaded from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC; https://cdec.water.ca.gov/) and cleaned with a series of quality control (QC) checks (see integrated dataset metadata).  We obtained bottom temperature data from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) internal database Water Quality Portal (WQP). Data were integrated and standardized to hourly water temperature data in degrees Celsius, and the same series of quality control (QC) checks from the surface dataset were applied in a consistent manner to all stations. Bottom temperatures were selected from surface temperatures to provide measures of temperature difference. Datasets included in this package include source hourly surface and bottom data, both obtained from DWR\u2019s WQP, as well as an integrated dataset of cleaned hourly surface and bottom data, with calculated surface-bottom temperature differences. Both datasets are filtered to the timeframe used in an analysis of surface-bottom temperature differences.  Additionally, information regarding current and historical sensors used for water temperature data collection was obtained from station managers for each station and compiled in a metadata table.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nNelson, Michelle; Pien, Catarina. 2021-12-22.

RST operations were conducted by CDFW and then under the\n    direction of the Yuba River Management Team from 1999 to 2009 at the\n    Hallwood Boulevard site; and resumed in 2022 by DWR. The Hallwood\n    site will essentially sample all areas of the lower Yuba River\n    upstream of Hallwood Boulevard. Additionally, the Hallwood site is\n    located downstream of the bulk of adult Chinook salmon spawning\n    areas and downstream of all known spring-run Chinook salmon\n    spawning. Data are currently being used to inform the development of\n    a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring-run Chinook salmon\n    in the Sacramento River Watershed as required by Incidental Take\n    Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 issued by CA Department of Fish and\n    Wildlife (CDFW) to DWR for the long-term operation of the State\n    Water Project.

In-lake monitoring (in-situ measurements) is needed to understand better the processes contributing to poor water quality. This data package contains the in-situ measurements collected by the University of California, Davis at Clear Lake between 2019 and 2023, which include: continous stream properties at three locations (Middle, Scott, and Kelsey Creeks); continuous meteorological variables at seven locations around the perimeter of the lake; continuous lake temperature and dissolved oxygen at multiple depths and locations across the lake (six permanent water quality stations); continuous lake surface temperature in the shoreline; and discreate samples to measure nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biovolumes and species identification throughout the water column and across all three lake basins every 6-8 weeks.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCort\u00e9s, Alicia; Schladow, Samuel; Forrest, Alexander; Sadro, Steven. 2025-06-27.

            "description": " The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) sets water quality objectives to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Bay. These objectives are met by establishing standards mandated in water right permits issued to the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation by the SWRCB. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels. In 1971, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This Decision contained new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. D-1379 was also the first water right decision to provide terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to routinely determine water quality conditions and changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. The monitoring program described in D-1379 was developed by the Stanford Research Institute through a contract with the SWRCB. Implementation of the monitoring program began in 1972, as SWRCB, DWR, and USBR met to define their individual responsibilities for various elements of the monitoring program. In 1978, amendments to water quality standards were implemented and resulted in Water Right Decision 1485 (D-1485). More recently these standards were again amended under the 1995 Water Quality Control Plan and Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) established in 1999. The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements described in D-1641. D-1641 requires DWR and USBR to conduct a comprehensive environmental monitoring program to determine compliance with the water quality standards and also to submit an annual report to SWRCB discussing data collected. The phytoplankton monitoring program is one element of DWR\u2019s and USBR\u2019s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton, and benthic organisms. The overall objective of the phytoplankton monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in phytoplankton diversity, abundance, and distribution associated with physical and other biological factors in the estuary.

            "description": " The Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s (Reclamation) Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California Department of Water Resource\u2019s (DWR) State Water Project (SWP) deliver millions of acre-feet of water annually for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and environmental needs in California from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta) through the C.W. \u201cBill\u201d Jones Pumping Plant (JPP) and Banks Pumping Plant.  Since 1957, a Reclamation operated fish salvage facility, the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF), is located upstream of the JPP and functions to salvage fish entrained in exported water (Bates and Vinsonhaler 1957).  Additionally, the John E. Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility (SDFPF) was added by the California Department of Water Resources in 1968 to salvage fishes diverted by the SWP.  The salvage process involves fish collection, counting, handling and transportation back to the Delta.  To prevent fish loss, CVP and SWP fish facilities were constructed at Old river, where fish are diverted to the fish facilities for counting and reporting.  After counting, the fish are collected in storage tanks and taken to several release locations in the Delta via fish-haul tank trucks.  Millions of fishes from 69 species are salvaged through this process by the two fish facilities.  Data collected includes species collected, fish lengths, water flow, export amounts, and water quality.  Fishes listed (Endangered Species Act (ESA) or California Endangered Species Act (CESA)) were Chinook Salmon, Delta Smelt, steelhead trout, Longfin Smelt, and Green Sturgeon.  The California Department of Fish and Wildlife monitors fish salvage and manages the data collected from the fish facilities in addition to data collected and managed by DWR and Reclamation.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAfentoulis, Virginia; Siddiqui, Samreen; Aasen, Geir; Griffiths, Walter; Malinich, Timothy; Damon, Lauren; Aasen, Geir; Aasen, Geir; Morinaka, Jerry; Reyes, Rene. 2024-08-29.

            "description": " The Continuous Environmental Monitoring Program (CEMP) plays an instrumental role in overseeing real-time water quality in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) and Suisun Bay. The program harnesses wireless telemetry to transmit crucial data to the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), making high-resolution environmental data pertaining to the Delta and Suisun Bay publicly accessible. The extensive dataset captures information at 15-minute intervals from 15 monitoring stations, utilizing YSI 6600 and YSI EXO sondes to obtain standalone water quality measurements.  This extensive dataset informs the operations of the California State Water Project, ensuring it adheres to mandated water quality standards set by Water Right Decision 1641. This data compilation incorporates all information since the transition to YSI multiparameter sondes in 2005. It is important to note that the commencement dates and subsequent upgrades vary between stations, leading to slight discrepancies in the dataset's date ranges.  Since its inception in the mid-1980s, CEMP has progressively expanded its monitoring capabilities, consistently augmenting the number of monitoring locations and the array of water quality parameters assessed. Its commitment to utilizing the most advanced water quality monitoring technology reaffirms its position as an environmental monitoring leader in the Delta and Suisun Bay. Today, the program oversees 15 water quality stations that reliably capture data every 15 minutes, each day of the year, transmitting this data in real-time.  The core tenents of CEMP: \u2022 to obtain consistent and accurate data in real-time at established monitoring stations \u2022 to provide data necessary to achieve compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards \u2022 to perform data analyses for further understanding of estuarine ecology \u2022 to report information to other government agencies, as well as the public, for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE). \u2022 to provide continuous water quality monitoring expertise for other groups within DWR and sister agencies for the benefit of ecological studies throughout the San Francisco- Sacramento Estuary\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nNelson, Michelle; Tran, Andrew. 2025-04-22.

            "title": "Monitoring juvenile Chinook salmon outmigration using rotary screw traps on the Sacramento River near Tisdale Weir",
            "description": " The Tisdale RST sampling site is operated by the California\n    Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to obtain information on the\n    temporal distribution, relative abundance, and composition of race\n    and species of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)\n    and steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the upper Sacramento\n    River and tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta).\n    The project collects data near the Tisdale Weir on the Sacramento\n    River, using two paired rotary screw traps (RSTs) outfitted with two\n    8-ft diameter cones. The RST monitoring site at Tisdale Weir was established meet a\n    requirement of the 2011 amendment to the reasonable and prudent\n    alternative (RPA) of the 2009 biological and conference opinion (BO)\n    on the long-term operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and\n    State Water Project (SWP). The amendment required the Bureau of\n    Reclamation (USBR) and the California Department of Water Resources\n    (DWR) to fund a new juvenile salmonid monitoring site on the\n    Sacramento River between Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD) and Knights\n    Landing. The purpose of the new site was to provide early warning of\n    fish movement and determine survival of listed fish species leaving\n    spawning habitat in the upper Sacramento River. CDFW issued ITP 2081-2019-066-00 to DWR on March 31, 2020, for the\n    long-term operation of the SWP in the Delta. Condition 7.5.2 of the\n    ITP requires the development and establishment of a spring-run\n    Chinook salmon juvenile production estimate (JPE) to increase\n    understanding regarding the impacts water operations have on the\n    spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. Data from the Tisdale RST will be used along with other\n    datasets from juvenile salmonid monitoring programs in the\n    Sacramento River Watershed to inform the development of JPE modeling\n    approaches. Salmonid data collected from the Tisdale RST, among other datasets,\n    is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the\n    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to\n    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that\n    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring\n    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets\n    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time\n    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation\n    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHuneycutt, Andrew. 2025-03-01.

Salmonid data collected from the Butte\n    Creek RST, among other datasets, is also used by the Salmon\n    Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the movement of juvenile salmon\n    in the Sacramento River Watershed to estimate the number of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that have entered the\n    Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). SaMT is a real-time operations\n    monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP\n    which meets weekly from October through June, to provide advice for\n    real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water\n    Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and\n    spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHenley, Grant. 2025-05-23.

            "description": " The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) conducts juvenile salmonid emigration monitoring on Mill and Deer Creek (Tehama County, CA) annually from October through June using rotary screw traps (RSTs). Data from this monitoring is used to estimate juvenile spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) (spring-run) abundance and passage, identify yearling outmigration timing and alert resource agencies of juvenile spring-run presence in the lower Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This data will be included in the development of a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring-run Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River as required by Condition of Approval 7.5.2 of Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) issued by CDFW to California Department of Water Resources (DWR) for the long-term operation of the State Water Project. Salmonid data collected from the Mill and Deer RSTs, among other datasets, is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that have entered the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta. This data package is complimentary to edi.1504 and represents current RST monitoring on Deer and Mill creeks.

            "title": "Monitoring juvenile Chinook salmon outmigration using rotary screw traps on the Sacramento River at Knights Landing",
            "description": " Since 1995, the rotary screw traps (RSTs) at Knights Landing have\n    provided water management agencies an early warning of emigrating\n    juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead\n    trout (O. mykiss) making their way to the Sacramento-San Joaquin\n    Delta (Delta). Due to the proximity of the site to other major\n    tributaries of the Sacramento River, such as the Feather and\n    American Rivers, it is assumed that salmonids captured at the\n    Knights Landing RSTs originate from the upper Sacramento River and\n    its tributaries, a stretch of river that provides spawning and\n    rearing habitat for all four runs of natural origin Chinook salmon:\n    winter-run (State and federally listed as endangered), spring-run\n    (State and federally listed as threatened), late fall-run and\n    fall-run, as well as steelhead trout (federally listed as\n    threatened). The near real-time information RST monitoring data provides on\n    emigration timing and relative abundance for protected runs of\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead improves the ability for\n    resource agencies and water managers to implement protective\n    measures that help them navigate through the maze of waterways in\n    the Delta. By utilizing emigration data in adaptive management,\n    reservoir releases, export rates, water transfers, and Delta Cross\n    Channel Gate operations can be modified to minimize the risk of\n    predation, entrainment, and take, thereby maximizing juvenile\n    salmonid survival through the Delta. The primary goals of the Knights Landing Monitoring Program are to\n    (1) Provide early warning of listed salmonids emigrating toward the\n    Delta, (2) Document passage of emigrating salmonids including\n    timing, relative abundance, and environmental conditions, (3)\n    Develop passage estimates of salmonids emigrating through the lower\n    Sacramento River above the Delta, and (4) Develop a long-term\n    dataset on juvenile salmonid emigration to compare changes over\n    time. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) issued ITP\n    2081-2019-066-00 to DWR on March 31, 2020, for the long-term\n    operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the Delta. Condition\n    7.5.2 of the ITP requires the development and establishment of a\n    spring-run Chinook salmon juvenile production estimate (JPE) to\n    increase understanding of the impacts water operations have on the\n    spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. Data from the Knights Landing RST will be used along\n    with other datasets from juvenile salmonid monitoring programs in\n    the Sacramento River Watershed to inform the development of JPE\n    modeling approaches. Salmonid data collected from the Knights Landing RST, among other\n    datasets, is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to\n    understand the movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed to estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon that have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time\n    operations monitoring team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2\n    of the ITP which meets weekly from October through June, to provide\n    advice for real-time management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and\n    the Water Operation Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon in the Delta. Note: data within the current year\u2019s monitoring season are\n    considered provisional.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBauer, Nick. 2025-04-23.

The LFC extends from the Fish\n    Barrier Dam at river mile (RM) 67.2 to the Thermalito Outlet (RM\n    59). The HFC extends from the Thermalito Outlet to the confluence\n    with the Sacramento River. This survey has been ongoing since 1997\n    with the objective of documenting general salmonid emigration\n    attributes, such as timing, abundance and composition of salmon and\n    investigating the influence of environmental factors thought to\n    initiate emigration, such as flow, turbidity and water temperature.\n    Data from this monitoring will also be used to inform the\n    development of a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed as required by\n    Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 issued by CA Department\n    of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to DWR for the long-term operation of\n    the State Water Project.

            "description": " Mountain lakes experience extreme inter-annual climate variation as\n  well as rapidly warming air temperatures, making them ideal systems to\n  understand lake-climate responses. Snowpack and water temperature are\n  highly correlated in mountain lakes, but we lack a complete\n  understanding of underlying mechanisms. Motivated by predicted\n  declines in snowfall with future temperature increases, we\n  investigated how surface heat fluxes and lake temperature responded to\n  variation in snowpack, ice-duration, and weather in a typical high\n  elevation lake in the Sierra Nevada, California. Ice duration\n  determined the phenology of lake exposure to solar radiation, and was\n  the dominant mechanism linking snowpack to lake temperature. The\n  relative importance of heat loss fluxes (longwave radiation, latent\n  and sensible heat exchange) varied among wet and dry years. Declines\n  in snowpack and ice cover in mountain systems will reduce the scale of\n  variation in lake thermal responses and increase the responsiveness of\n  lake warming to atmospheric forcing.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSmits, Adrianne; Sadro, Steven. 2019-11-04.

            "description": " The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) issued\n    Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) to the California\n    Department of Water Resources (DWR) on March 31, 2020, for the\n    long-term operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the\n    Sacramento San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Condition 7.5.2 of the ITP\n    requires the development and establishment of a spring-run Chinook\n    salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) juvenile production estimate (JPE)\n    to increase understanding of the impacts that water operations have\n    on the spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and to inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. As a part of the JPE effort, CDFW began operating a new rotary screw\n    trap (RST) monitoring station on the lower Sacramento River near\n    River Mile (RM) 75, approximately 5 miles below the confluence of\n    the Feather and Sacramento Rivers, in January 2022. This RST\n    location represents the lowest point in the Sacramento River\n    Watershed where juvenile salmon are trapped prior to entering the\n    Delta and thus is also referred to as the \u201cDelta Entry\u201d site. The\n    expanded juvenile monitoring effort will help resource agencies and\n    water managers identify numbers of salmon emigrating from the\n    Sacramento and Feather River watersheds and contributing to the\n    spring-run Chinook salmon population entering the Delta. Data collected by the RST site at the Lower Sacramento River\n    provides information on the temporal distribution, relative\n    abundance, and race composition of juvenile Chinook salmon; and\n    temporal distribution and relative abundance of steelhead trout (O.\n    mykiss) emigrating from the upper Sacramento River and Feather River\n    to the Delta. Salmonid data collected from the Lower Sacramento\n    River RST, among other datasets, is also used by the Salmon\n    Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the movement of juvenile salmon\n    in the Sacramento River Watershed to estimate the number of\n    winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that have entered the\n    Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring team required by\n    Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets weekly from\n    October through June, to provide advice for real-time management of\n    SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation Management Team\n    (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon\n    in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStark, Rebecca. 2023-09-20.

            "title": "UC Davis Suisun Marsh Fish Study, CA,1980-2024",
            "description": " Suisun Marsh, at the geographic center of the northern San Francisco Estuary, provides important habitat for native and non-native fishes, as well as many valued and endangered plants, reptiles, mammals, and birds. The University of California, Davis, Suisun Marsh Fish Study, in partnership with the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), has systematically monitored the marsh's fish populations since January 1980 (O'Rear et al. 2023). The study\u2019s main purpose has been to determine natural and human-caused factors affecting fish and invertebrate distribution and abundance. All sampling has occurred in Suisun Marsh, mostly in subtidal sloughs. Sampling began in 1979, but standardized methods and stations were not implemented until 1980. Sampling has occurred monthly from January 1980 to the present at geographically fixed stations. Fixed stations have been necessary because snags preclude uninterrupted trawls in many sections of smaller sloughs. Originally, 48 stations were selected haphazardly that could be easily and safely sampled by boat and covered the breadth of Suisun Marsh to ensure capture of all variability in fish populations. However, the emphasis has been on sampling smaller sloughs because they exhibit greater variability in a smaller space than the marsh's two big sloughs (Suisun and Montezuma), and because only the big sloughs are sampled by other long-term monitoring projects such as California Fish and Wildlife's Fall Midwater Trawl. The 48 stations were sampled in 1980 and 1981. Water quality and catches were then compared across these stations to locate redundancies and thereby improve logistical efficiency while maximizing capture of variation by eliminating uninformative stations (Brown et al. 1981). Seventeen stations were then chosen and were continuously sampled from 1980 through 1993. Geographic scope was reassessed in 1994, when sampling was reinitiated in the northeast marsh in Denverton and Nurse sloughs at four stations (DV2, DV3, NS2, NS3; Figure B), in part to look for dwindling fish species [e.g., delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus)]. Catches in Nurse and Denverton sloughs were found to be unique (Matern et al. 2002); thereafter, those four stations have been included in the regular sampling, with a total of 21 stations. In 2014, to complement continuous water-quality sampling from the salinity control gates to the very top of Denverton Slough (Montgomery et al. 2016), three more stations as part of the UC Davis Arc Project were added to the 21 stations, resulting in 24 stations that are currently sampled monthly. These three additional stations (DV1, NS1, and MZ6) have also been retained because (1) they better captured gradients in water-quality conditions less discernable with the four stations (Montgomery et al. 2015), and (2) they surround areas slated for tidal restoration, increasing baseline information needed to assess restoration actions. Additionally, the transect from the MZ1 station in Montezuma Slough to the DV1 station also allows assessment of the extent of the impact of the salinity control gates (Beakes et al. 2020) in the most valuable area of the marsh for fishes (Moyle et al. 2014). Many other stations were sampled intermittently for small ancillary projects to the Suisun Marsh Fish Study. Two dedicated people - the Principal Investigator and the Supervisor - have been the primary ones paid on the study, with crews filled out with part-time staff and/or volunteers, generally graduate students but also undergraduate students, agency employees, or any other person interested in Suisun Marsh. Most supervisors have been graduate students of Peter Moyle. Most crews have consisted of three people, often four, and sometimes only two if both people are well-versed in all aspects of the sampling. Literature Cited Beakes, Michael P., Cory Graham, J.

            "description": " CDFW issued Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) to the\n    California Department of Water Resources (DWR) on March 31, 2020,\n    for the long-term operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the\n    Sacramento San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Condition 7.5.2 of the ITP\n    requires the development and establishment of a spring-run Chinook\n    salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) juvenile production estimate (JPE)\n    to increase understanding of the impacts that water operations have\n    on the spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River\n    watershed and to inform the development of minimization measures to\n    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage\n    facilities. As a part of the JPE effort, CDFW began operating a new rotary screw\n    trap (RST) monitoring station on the lower Feather River near River\n    Mile 17, approximately 1 mile downstream of Star Bend Park and Boat\n    Ramp near Olivehurst, in January 2022. This RST location represents\n    the lowest point in the Feather River Watershed where juvenile\n    salmon are sampled with an RST prior to entering the Sacramento\n    River and includes salmon emigrating from the Yuba River. The\n    expanded juvenile monitoring effort will help resource agencies and\n    water managers identify numbers of salmon emigrating from the\n    Feather River Watershed and contributing to the spring-run Chinook\n    salmon population entering the Delta. Monitoring is conducted annually from October through June utilizing\n    a pair of eight-foot rotary screw traps (RST). Data collected at the\n    Lower Feather River RST site provides information on the temporal\n    distribution, relative abundance, and race composition of juvenile\n    Chinook salmon; and temporal distribution and relative abundance of\n    steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the Feather River and\n    tributaries, including the Yuba River, to the Delta. Salmonid data\n    collected from the Lower Feather River RST, among other datasets, is\n    also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the\n    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to\n    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that\n    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring\n    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets\n    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time\n    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation\n    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run\n    Chinook salmon in the Delta.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBryant, Claire. 2023-12-01.

            "description": " The Enhanced Large Fish Study (ELFS) was established and included in the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) work plan in 2023 to fill some of the monitoring gap of fishes in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California. The fish monitoring of the IEP prior to ELFS primarily consisted of trawl- and seine-based surveys, which generally capture small and/or juvenile fishes due to survey gear and methodologies. In order to more effectively sample the large/adult fish portion of SFE fish communities, the ELFS uses American Fisheries Society experimental gillnets, plus the inclusion of the optional \"large fish panel,\" to sample the waters of the SFE. The experimental gillnets measure 24.4m in length, 1.8m in depth, and includes eight 3m length panels with stretch mesh measurements of 76.2mm, 114.3mm, 50.8mm, 88.9mm, 38.1mm, 127.0mm, 63.5mm, and 101.6mm. The optional large fish panel measures 9.1m by 1.8m in depth and includes three 3m length panels with stretch mesh measurements of 152.4, 177.8, and 203.2mm. The ELFS conducted its first year of sampling in the North Delta, California, in 2023, and will be expanded to the greater Delta and Suisun Bay and Marsh in future sampling years. The ELFS is currently funded as a special study to inform future monitoring, with funding contracted through fiscal year 2026-2027.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStompe, Dylan; Hobbs, James. 2023-11-01.

            "description": " <anchor id=\"_Hlk62995535\"/>Warming winters will reduce ice cover and\n  change under-ice conditions in temperate mountain lakes, where snow\n  comprises most of winter cover on lakes. Snow-dominated mountain lakes\n  are abundant and highly susceptible to climate warming, yet we lack an\n  understanding of how climate variation and local attributes influence\n  winter processes. We investigated climatic and intrinsic controls on\n  ice phenology, water temperature, and bottom-water dissolved oxygen\n  (DO) in 15 morphologically diverse lakes in the Sierra Nevada and\n  Klamath mountains of California, USA, using high frequency\n  measurements from multiple (2-5) winters. We found that ice phenology\n  was determined by winter climate variables (snowfall, air temperature)\n  that influence ice-off timing, whereas ice-on timing was relatively\n  invariant among years. Lake size and morphology mediated the effect of\n  climate on lake temperature and DO dynamics in early and late winter.\n  Rates of hypolimnetic DO decline were highest in small, shallow lakes,\n  and were unrelated to water temperature. Temperature and oxygen\n  dynamics were more variable in small lakes because heavy snowfall\n  caused ice submergence, mixing, and DO replenishment that affected the\n  entire water column. As persistence of snow declines in temperate\n  mountain regions, autumn and spring climatic conditions are expected\n  to gain importance in regulating lake ice phenology. Water temperature\n  and DO will likely increase in most lakes during winter as snowpack\n  declines, but morphological attributes such as lake size will\n  determine the sensitivity of ice phenology and under-ice processes to\n  climate change.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSmits, Adrianne. 2021-07-07.

These efforts which are tied to regulations set forth by the Biological Opinion, will have unknown impacts to in\u2010stream water quality. For this reason, the Department of Water Resources\u2019 Water Quality Assessment (WQA) unit developed a monitoring program to establish baseline water quality measurements to help understand the environmental impact of these restoration projects and ensure pre\u2010restoration water quality data is available to compare against post-restoration water quality. To do so, data was collected at various sites that represent all major inputs and outflows within the Cache Slough Complex from September 2013 to December 2021.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nDel Cid, Jeremy; Brown, Travis. 2024-08-07.

            "description": " Understanding how fish presence is related to habitat features is\n    useful in restoration planning and monitoring as better information\n    about how fish use habitat may lead to more impactful restoration\n    projects. The California Department of Water Resources (DWR),\n    conducted a two-year study of microhabitat and mesohabitat in\n    Feather River. The goal of this study was to identify relationships\n    between habitat conditions (depth, substrate, velocity, and cover)\n    and where juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead occur.\u00a0Snorkel\n    surveys were conducted monthly March through August in 2001 and 2002\n    across 29 different sites, which were selected at random (13 in Low\n    Flow Channel, and 16 in High Flow Channel). Each sampling section\n    covered an area 25 meters long by 4 meters wide, running parallel to\n    riverbank. These data were published to support the Healthy Rivers\n    and Landscapes Science Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nKurth, Ryon. 2024-12-26.

            "description": " We compile and release ~55 years of daily and ~20 years of hourly\n  Micrometeorological and hydrological data from Sagehen Creek a 28\n  km???^2??? watershed with observation sites spanning 1771 to 2670 m. A\n  USGS gauging station measures streamflow at the catchment outlet.\n  There are three Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations: Independence\n  Camp(2128 m), Independence Creek (1962 m) and Independence Lake (2541\n  m) that measure hourly precipitation, temperature, soil moisture (at\n  5, 20, and 50 cm), as well as daily snow water equivalent (SWE) and\n  snow depth. A new method was used to estimate hourly precipitation\n  data using quality controlled daily totals. A NOAA cooperative\n  observer (COOP) station measures daily precipitation, temperature,\n  SWE, and snow depth from 1953-1997 and then measures hourly\n  precipitation, temperature, SWE, and snow depth, relative humidity,\n  and solar radiation from 2001 through 2017 2001-present. There are an\n  additional three towers with data beginning in 2009 measuring snow\n  depth, SWE, solar radiation, barometric pressure, precipitation,\n  relative humidity, and temperature: Tower 1 (1934m), Tower 3 (2114 m),\n  and Tower 4 (2350 m). Wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity\n  measured at 7.6 and 30.5 m at each site. Data from all stations were\n  checked for poor QA/QC and substantial and sophisticated gap-filling\n  techniques were deployed. This dataset holds potential for improving\n  understanding of orographic processes and their implications for\n  streamflow generation in a groundwater-dominated watershed. This data\n  package mirrors the one available at\n  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2590799.

            "description": " Since 1999, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has\n    conducted annual snorkel surveys to monitor juvenile salmon on the\n    Feather River. The objective of this data collection effort is to\n    determine the relative abundance and distribution of rearing\n    juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead. A secondary objective is to\n    collect baseline data for future monitoring programs associated with\n    habitat restoration projects. Crews survey units within 20 sampling\n    sections on the high flow (HFC) and low flow channel (LFC) between\n    January and September and collect information on species, fish size,\n    substrate, cover, and habitat type. This dataset represents an\n    extensive time series that could be used to identify habitat\n    conditions where juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead occur and how\n    these conditions have changed over time. These data were published\n    to support the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCampos, Casey. 2024-09-27.

Starting in 2001, SBC also began archive\n  high-frequency data from County stations with active data loggers\n  which are available in other SBC data packages. These data were collected in accordance with current industry\n  standards. The data are contained in 3 tables, for stations with\n  active data loggers and tipping gauges, active stations with other\n  types of gauges, and inactive stations. Only data collected with\n  tipping gauges and data loggers can be interpolated to to the\n  resolution required by SBC's research objectives, and so only this\n  data table will be updated (annually, at the end of the water year).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nMelack, John M. 2019-10-01.

Fishes are commonly\n  preserved in formalin; however, formalin preservation is associated\n  with reduced fish length and increased weight, but the magnitude and\n  timing of these changes may vary among species. Unaccounted for\n  preservation-driven shifts in fish length and weight may have drastic\n  effects on any conservation or ecological conclusions drawn from\n  specimen preserved for various durations as well as when compared to\n  fresh, unpreserved specimen. The \u200bpurpose of this study was to \u200btest\n  whether formalin fixation and preservation affects endangered Delta\n  Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSlater, Steven; Burdi, Christina; Gaeta, Jereme; Frick, Madeleine. 2020-08-31.

            "description": " Projected temperature increases due to global climate change are\n  likely to have localized impacts on the San Francisco Estuary (SFE).\n  Increased water temperature in the SFE will lead to challenges for\n  managing water resources. Many native species, such as salmon and\n  smelt, rely on cooler water, and will be further stressed by increased\n  water temperature. While real-time water temperature is collected by\n  several state and federal agencies in the San Francisco Estuary, a\n  landscape-scale synthesis of available water temperature data has not\n  been conducted for the SFE. For this dataset, we compiled continuous\n  water temperature data and associated metadata from the SFE to\n  generate an integrated and usable dataset of known quality for climate\n  and ecological analysis. Data were obtained from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC;\n  https://cdec.water.ca.gov/) for consistency (data are untreated) and\n  efficiency (existing code to download data directly from CDEC). Data\n  were integrated and standardized to hourly water temperature data in\n  degrees Celsius. A series of quality control (QC) checks were then\n  applied in a consistent manner to all stations. Datasets included in\n  this package include raw hourly data, flagged data, and filtered data\n  (where flagged data are removed). Additionally, information regarding\n  current and historical sensors used for water temperature data\n  collection was obtained from station managers for each station, and\n  compiled in a metadata table.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Hamilton, Jasmine; Hartman, Rosemary; Nelson, Michelle; Saraceno, JohnFranco; Schreier, Brian; Davis, Brittany; Department of Water Resources. 2020-08-23.

            "description": " Predicting plant mortality during floods remains a key area of\n  uncertainty for both river managers and ecologists, particularly how\n  flood hydraulics and sediment dynamics interact with the plants\u2019 own\n  traits to influence their vulnerability to scour and burial. The three\n  datasets in this archive were collected from a series of flume\n  experiments that took place at the University of California,\n  Berkeley\u2019s Richmond Field Station. The flume experiments are part of a\n  larger study, funded by NSF (EAR#1024820) that quantified reciprocal\n  effects and feedbacks between riparian seedlings and river\n  morphodynamics, using sand-bed rivers in the U.S. Southwest as the\n  reference system. To quantify different plant species\u2019 vulnerability\n  to flooding across a range of plant sizes, patch densities, and\n  sediment condition (equilibrium transport versus sediment deficit), we\n  ran 10 experimental floods using live seedlings of cottonwood and\n  tamarisk, which have contrasting morphologies. The three datasets\n  include: 1. Plant responses (dislodgement or burial) to the\n  experimental floods and plant size (e.g. stem height, root length, and\n  dry weight) for all plants tested during the flume runs (N = 484,\n  comprising 326 cottonwood and 158 tamarisk); 2. Plant morphological\n  traits (e.g. frontal area, bending force, and root diameter) for a\n  random subset of seedlings (n = 90, comprising 47 cottonwood and 43\n  tamarisk); and 3. Frontal area density for the same seedling subset.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nKui, Li; Stella, John C.; Diehl, Rebecca M.; Wilcox, Andrew C.; Lightbody, Anne; Sklar, Leonard S.. 2018-08-16.

            "description": " Fish entrainment into California's State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) has been a source of mortality for native osmerid species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys). While entrained adult and juvenile fishes are collected, identified and enumerated, the facilities design does not allow for a quantifiable estimate of larval fishes being entrained. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for managers to make scientifically informed decisions regarding the endangered Longfin & Delta Smelt. The Larval Entrainment Study (LES) aims to address this gap by providing a high-resolution dataset and insights into the variable abundances of Smelt at risk of entrainment, the community composition surrounding them, and associated water quality data. Our study design utilizes a variety of gear types and maximizes replicates to improve the understanding of larval Smelt abundances within the southern reach of the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Delta, the zone of entrainment for the SWP and CVP. Sampling began in 2022 using 10-minute stepped oblique tows of a Smelt Larval Survey (SLS) sled mounted with a 500 \u03bcm net. Tows were conducted in West Canal, outside Clifton Court Forebay (CCF), where the risk of entrainment is highest. Sampling was conducted five days a week in 2022 and three days a week in the following years. . Beginning in mid-January 2023, a 940 \u03bcm mesh net with the same dimensions as the SLS net was added, with sampling alternating between the two. This provided an intermediate gear between SLS (500 \u03bcm) and 20mm (1600 \u03bcm) nets. In 2024 we expanded to sample a transect of sites within the Old and Middle River (OMR) corridor. This provides broader spatial resolution and improves our ability to detect Osmerids within the South Delta. Sampling alternated between a high priority day (with intensive sampling in the lower San Joaquin River, SLS stations 809 & 812) and a longer transect day that ran the length of the OMR corridor( at SLS stations 809, 812, 902, 915 & 918). We also began to sample using a bongo sled, which allows two nets to sample side by side. This data also includes our special studies; a day/night comparison conducted in 2022, a gear comparison in 2023, and a second day/night comparison study in 2024.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGilbert, Morgan; Malinich, Timothy; Griffiths, Kyle; Afentoulis, Virginia. 2025-07-01.

            "description": " Since 2014, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has\n    conducted annual Chinook salmon redd surveys. The objective of this\n    data collection effort is to quantify and understand potential shits\n    in redd distribution and potential habitat differences between\n    historic and restored sites. The redd surveys are conducted in the\n    uppermost 16 miles of the lower Feather River though have been\n    concentrated in the uppermost two miles of the lower Feather River\n    in, and adjacent to the Gravel Supplementation Areas (GSAs). Redd\n    surveys are conducted less frequently in the 14 miles downstream of\n    the GSAs. Surveys typically begin in mid-September at the onset of\n    spawning and generally conclude at the end of November. This dataset\n    represents an extensive time series that could be used to identify\n    habitat conditions where Chinook salmon spawn, how these conditions\n    have changed over time, especially in areas where restoration has\n    occurred. These data were published to support the Healthy Rivers\n    and Landscapes Program.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCook, Chris. 2025-03-06.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "description": " Drivers of phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics vary spatially and temporally in estuaries due to variation in hydrodynamic exchange and residence time, complicating efforts to understand controls on food web productivity. We conducted approximately monthly (2012 \u2013 2019; n = 74) longitudinal sampling at ten fixed stations along a freshwater tidal terminal channel in the San Francisco Estuary, California, characterized by seaward to landward gradients in water residence time, turbidity, nutrient concentrations, and plankton community composition. We used multivariate autoregressive state space (MARSS) models to quantify environmental (abiotic) and biotic controls on phytoplankton and mesozooplankton biomass. The importance of specific abiotic drivers (e.g. water temperature, turbidity, nutrients) and trophic interactions differed significantly among hydrodynamic exchange zones with different mean residence times. Abiotic drivers explained more variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics than a model including only trophic interactions, but individual phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions explained more variation than individual abiotic drivers. Interactions between zooplankton and phytoplankton were strongest in landward reaches with the longest residence times and the highest zooplankton biomass. Interactions between cryptophytes and both copepods and cladocerans were stronger than interactions between bacillariophytes (diatoms) and zooplankton taxa, despite contributing less biovolume in all but the most landward reaches. Our results demonstrate that trophic interactions and their relative strengths vary in a hydrodynamic context, contributing to food web heterogeneity within estuaries at spatial scales smaller than the freshwater to marine transition.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSmits, Adrianne; VanNieuwenhuyse, Erwin; Dahlgren, Randy; Stumpner, Paul. 2023-01-24.

            "description": " Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fisheries and invertebrate monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass since 1998. The main objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to collect baseline data on lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and insect drift), juvenile and adult fish, hydrology, and water quality parameters. As the Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by numerous regulatory agencies, these baseline data are critical for evaluating success of future restoration projects. In addition, the data have already served to increase our understanding of the role of the Yolo Bypass in the life history of native fishes, and its ecological function in the San Francisco Estuary. Zooplankton are an important component in the diet of larval, juvenile, and small adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, Striped Bass, and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects zooplankton year-round from two sites. Since 2011, samples have been collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using 150- and 50- micrometer mesh plankton nets. Zooplankton are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently BSA Environmental Services). The goals of the zooplankton monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variation in species densities and trends between (1) the Sacramento River channel, and (2) the Yolo Bypass, the river\u2019s seasonal floodplain. Data on zooplankton catch and associated water quality parameters are presented in this dataset.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole. 2021-12-09.

            "description": " The objective of our study is to better understand the factors affecting chlorophyll-a production within a floodplain and its transport downstream to determine how lateral connectivity influences longitudinal connectivity.  The Yolo Bypass is an engineered floodplain of the Sacramento River that inundates during periods of high outflow via overtopping weirs. Water traveling through the Yolo Bypass flows parallel to the Sacramento River and re-connects to the mainstem at the southern extent of the floodplain. Several monitoring programs in the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta and Yolo Bypass collect discrete and continuous water quality data, including chlorophyll measurements. For this study, we synthesized available flow, water temperature, chlorophyll and inundation data between March 1999 to December 2019 and modeled the effects of environmental variables and inundation on chlorophyll-a production in the floodplain, the mainstem, and downstream of the floodplain/mainstem.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPien, Catarina; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Goertler, Pascale; Peek, Ryan; Chapple, Dylan; Yamane, Lauren; Berglund, Mattea; Khanna, Shruti; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Adams, Jesse; Pien, Catarina; Goertler, Pascale ; Pien, Catarina; Goertler, Pascale ; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Ruhl, Catherine; Cheng, Robin. 2023-12-13.

            "description": " This dataset was collected as part of a large-scale study to assess impacts of smoke cover on gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R) in California lakes. The 10 study lakes span large gradients in elevation, size, nutrient concentrations, and water clarity. They include 5 ponds and lakes in Sequoia National Park, Lake Tahoe, Dulzura Lake, Clear Lake, Castle Lake, and a site in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Metabolic rates in the upper mixed layer of each lake was estimated from hourly in-situ sensor data during the three smokiest years in California since 2006 (2018, 2020, 2021). The dataset includes daily estimates of GPP and R, mean daily values of variables used in metabolism models (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, mixed layer depth, photosynthetically active radiation, wind speed), and mean daily values of metrics related to smoke cover (shortwave radiation, PM2.5, smoke density derived from remote-sensing).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSmits, Adrianne; Scordo, Facundo; Tang, Minmeng; Farruggia, Mary; Cortes, Alicia; Watanabe, Shohei. 2024-04-12.

            "description": "  2019 Water Year (October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019) In the winter and spring of 2018-2019, 5,000 acres of agricultural land in Yolo County, California was intentionally flooded. These \u201cdry-side\u201d rice fields, although on the former floodplain of the Sacramento River, are separated from the fish-bearing Sacramento River (the \u201cwet-side\u201d) by high flood levees. Today, levees cut off 95% of the Central Valley\u2019s floodplains from river channels so that Central Valley aquatic ecosystems no longer recruit floodplain the food web resources needed to support robust aquatic food webs, create fish biomass and sustain abundant fish populations. In this experiment we asked whether floodplain food web resources \u201cgrown\u201d in intentionally inundated \u201cdry-side\u201d agricultural fields could be exported back to the river via flood drainage infrastructure. If so, we were interested to know whether those resources could improve juvenile salmon foraging success and increase growth rates. In order to test these questions, we caged fish in the floodplain drainage canal, at the location where the floodplain drainage water entered the river and at locations both up- and downstream. We hypothesized that zooplankton abundance and fish growth rates would be elevated at the managed floodplain outfall location, relative to the upstream location. We measured water quality parameters, zooplankton species assemblage and abundance, and juvenile Chinook salmon growth rates with PIT tagged, hatchery-origin fish confined to enclosures at the study locations. The 5,000 acres of managed floodplain was drained over the coarse of 5 weeks in February and March, 2019 at a maximum rate of 1,000 cfs. The Sacramento River flow during the experiment ranged from 20,000-30,000 cfs. Fish growth rates at the floodplain outfall location were up to five times greater than growth rates upstream of the outfall and enclosure fish experienced growth rate benefits at least up to a mile downstream from the managed floodplain outfall. This study demonstrated a management practice that transfers floodplain food web benefits from managed floodplains without anadromous fish access, to the food-scarce Sacramento River ecosystem. Multiple districts across the Sacramento Valley maintain similar water infrastructure to what was used in this pilot action. If incorporated at large scale into water management practices, fish food production on \u201cdry-side\u201d agricultural fields and wildlife refuges could contribute substantial food resources to rearing and out-migrating juvenile salmon populations in the Sacramento River system.  2020 Water Year (October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020) No Fish Food project was implemented this year.  2021 Water Year (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021) In the winter and spring of 2020-2021, 8,775 acres of agricultural land in Yolo County, California was intentionally flooded. These \u201cdry-side\u201d rice fields, although on the former floodplain of the Sacramento River, are separated from the fish-bearing Sacramento River (the \u201cwet-side\u201d) by high flood levees.

The 8,775 acres of managed floodplain was drained over the coarse of 5 weeks in February and March, 2021 at a maximum rate of 1,000 cfs. The Sacramento River flow during the experiment ranged from 3,000-12,000 cfs. Fish growth rates at the floodplain outfall location were up to twelve times greater than growth rates upstream of the outfall and enclosure fish experienced growth rate benefits at least up to six miles downstream from the managed floodplain outfall. This study demonstrated a management practice that transfers floodplain food web benefits from managed floodplains without anadromous fish access, to the food-scarce Sacramento River ecosystem. Multiple districts across the Sacramento Valley maintain similar water infrastructure to what was used in this pilot action. If incorporated at large scale into water management practices, fish food production on \u201cdry-side\u201d agricultural fields and wildlife refuges could contribute substantial food resources to rearing and out-migrating juvenile salmon populations in the Sacramento River system.  2022 Water Year (October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022) In the winter and spring of 2021-2022, 9,943 acres of agricultural land in Yolo County, California was intentionally flooded. These \u201cdry-side\u201d rice fields, although on the former floodplain of the Sacramento River, are separated from the fish-bearing Sacramento River (the \u201cwet-side\u201d) by high flood levees.

The 9,943 acres of managed floodplain was drained over the coarse of 5 weeks in February and March, 2022 at a maximum rate of 300 cfs. The Sacramento River flow during the experiment ranged from 3,000-5,000 cfs. Fish growth rates at the floodplain outfall location were up to three times greater than growth rates upstream of the outfall. This study demonstrated a management practice that transfers floodplain food web benefits from managed floodplains without anadromous fish access, to the food-scarce Sacramento River ecosystem.

            "description": " The upper San Francisco Bay Estuary and Sacramento San Joaquin Delta is critical habitat for the endemic Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered planktivorous fish with an annual, semi-anadromous life cycle. Freshwater outflow actions during the fall season are hypothesized to improve Delta Smelt habitat and therefore Delta Smelt condition before the spawning life stage. As part of efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of such actions to benefit Delta Smelt populations, various studies were initiated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation under the Directed Outflow Project (DOP). One component of the DOP was to evaluate how the Fall X2 freshwater outflow action changed the lower trophic prey available to Delta Smelt. The action is hypothesized to change abiotic and biotic aspects that can benefit Delta Smelt habitat by using freshwater outflow to maintain the position of X2 (defined as the distance in kilometers from the Golden Gate Bridge to the tidally averaged 2 ppt salinity isohaline) at around 70 km during wet or above normal precipitation water years. This moves the low salinity zone (0.5 - 6 ppt) further seaward into Suisun Bay which increases the area of preferred Delta Smelt habitat. Field sampling began the September of 2017 and occurred bi-weekly through the end of November, paired with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program. Three random sites were sampled per target region (Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, the Lower Sacramento River, the Cache Slough Complex, and the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel) per week. Sites were chosen using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified design. During 2018, sampling was increased to weekly and in 2019-2020 sampling began in April and ended in November. Sampling occurs for three different habitat types: shoal, channel surface and channel deep at each site depending on the depth of the water column. The shoal habitat is less than 10 feet, channel habitat is greater than 10 feet and channel deep habitat is greater than 20 feet. Plankton nets are towed approximately 0.5-meters below the surface in shoal and channel habitats and targeting the lower half to lower third of the water column in channel deep habitats. Two size classes of zooplankton are targeted using a pair of nets with different mesh sizes: mesozooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with a 150 micrometer mesh net and macrozooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with a 500 micrometer mesh net. Before each zooplankton tow water quality variables (temperature, dissolve oxygen, turbidity, specific conductivity, salinity, pH, and chlorophyll-a) are measured using a YSI EXO 2 sonde, 1 meter below the surface for channel surface and shoal habitats or at the target tow depth for channel deep habitats. Alongside zooplankton tows, phytoplankton samples are taken from a water sample and preserved in a Lugol's solution. In addition, whole water samples are filtered for nutrient (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and dissolved organic carbon) and chlorophyll-a analysis. These samples are only taken at the channel surface and shoal habitats. This dataset has been used in numerous manuscripts, reports, and technical reports to examine the state of the lower trophic food web in the context of available food for Delta Smelt.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSchultz, Andrew; Kalmbach, Andrew. 2023-05-15.

            "description": " A changing climate and increasing human population necessitate understanding global freshwater availability and temporal variability. To examine lake freshwater availability from local-to-global and monthly-to-decadal scales, we created the Global Lake area, Climate, and Population (GLCP) dataset, which contains annual lake surface area for 1.42 million lakes with paired annual basin-level climate and population data. Building off an existing data product infrastructure, the next generation of the GLCP includes monthly lake ice area, snow basin area, and more climate variables including specific humidity, longwave and shortwave radiation, as well as cloud cover. The new generation of the GLCP continues previous FAIR data efforts by expanding its scripting repository and maintaining unique relational keys for merging with external data products. Compared to the original version, the new GLCP contains an even richer suite of variables capable of addressing disparate analyses of lake water trends at wide spatial and temporal scales.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nMeyer, Michael; Brousil, Matthew; Virdis, Salvatore; Yang, Xiao; Cramer, Alli; Das, Pratyush; McClure, Ryan; Katz, Stephen; Hampton, Stephanie. 2024-08-11.

            "description": " The MacroSheds dataset is an ongoing synthesis of data records from small-watershed ecosystem studies, including those managed by LTER, CZO/CZNet, NEON, and many other networks. While details of instrumentation and sampling methods vary across these studies, the types of data collected and the questions that motivate their analysis are remarkably similar. Nevertheless, little effort toward the compilation of these datasets has previously been made, and comparative watershed analyses have remained limited in scale. The MacroSheds dataset includes daily time series of streamflow (discharge) and stream chemistry, as well as precipitation and precipitation chemistry where available. Each of the 200+ watersheds included in the MacroSheds dataset is described by a comprehensive collection of watershed attributes, summarized from a diverse set of gridded data products. A subset of these watershed attributes conform as closely as possible to the specifications of the CAMELS dataset (https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels), allowing the MacroSheds dataset to function as a small-watershed supplement to that corpus, and a resource for hydrologists as well as biogeochemists and watershed ecosystem scientists.

            "description": " The Fish Restoration Program Monitoring Team assesses the biological effectiveness of 8,000+ acres of tidal wetland restoration in the Upper San Francisco Estuary (Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh) through a contract with the CA Department of Water Resources. The restoration is pursuant to requirements in the 2008/2009 and 2019 Biological Opinions for state and federal water project operations. Data on fish and invertebrate abundance on or near these sites was collected as baseline monitoring data and to determine the most efficient methods for monitoring wetlands. Understanding how invertebrate, fish, and phytoplankton communities change pre- to post-restoration is essential to evaluating the benefits of tidal wetlands to native fish species. Invertebrate data was collected using sweep nets, benthic cores, neuston nets, and zooplankton trawls. Fish data was collected using otter trawls, lampara nets, and beach seines. For each method, the team recorded the catch of fish, invertebrates, and other organisms, length of selected organisms, and a suite of environmental information, including: dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, and dissolved organic carbon. Additional water quality samples, processed for Chlorophyll a, Dissolved Ammonia, Dissolved Nitrite + Nitrate, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Dissolved Organic Nitrogen, Dissolved Ortho-phosphate, Pheophytin a, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Total Organic Carbon, Total Phosphorus, and Total Suspended Solids, were collected at a subset of sampling sites. Data are collected before and after restoration at project and reference sites (Before-After-Control-Impact-design), as well as at adjacent water bodies.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBowles, Christy; Sherman, Stacy; Avila, Michelle; Cox, Daniel; Murray, Emma; Chavez, Amanda; Dungey, Darian; Ng, Gabriel; Hartman, Rosemary; Ellis, Daniel; Contreras, Dave. 2025-04-30.

Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Board's Water Right Decision D-1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For over five decades, this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distributional patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting changes in community composition. The Zooplankton Study uses three gear types to sample macro-, meso-, and micro-zooplankton across the upper SFE on a monthly basis.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nShaw, Caroline. 2025-06-20.

            "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Zooplankton abundance in the Upper San Francisco Estuary from 1972-2021, an integration of 7 long-term monitoring programs",
            "description": " The upper San Francisco Estuary is an inland inverse delta formed by\n    the confluence of 5 major rivers that drain 40% of the land in\n    California (USA). It is a central hub of water delivery in\n    California and home to a number of commercially important and\n    endangered fish, such as Chinook Salmon, Green Sturgeon, and Delta\n    Smelt. To monitor the environmental impacts of water exports from\n    this system, extensive ecological monitoring has been conducted\n    since the 1960s. To track lower trophic levels, zooplankton\n    abundance has been monitored from 1972 to present. Starting with\n    just one survey (the CA Department of Water Resources\u2019 [CDWR] and\n    California Department of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s [CDFW] Environmental\n    Monitoring Program) in 1972, the suite of zooplankton surveys\n    gradually expanded with time. Several surveys traditionally focused\n    on monitoring fish abundance added zooplankton nets to their\n    sampling programs. The CDFW 20-mm larval fish survey added\n    zooplankton sampling in 1995, the CDWR Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring\n    Program add zooplankton in 1999, the CDFW Summer Townet Survey added\n    zooplankton in 2005, and the Fall Midwater Trawl added zooplankton\n    in 2007. Two new sampling programs, the Fish Restoration Program and\n    Directed Outflow Project, began in 2015 and 2017, respectively. All\n    sampling programs continue today. Each survey samples once or twice\n    monthly at set of fixed or random stations that varies across\n    surveys depending on their objectives. While the Environmental\n    Monitoring Program samples year-round, the other surveys are mostly\n    seasonal, although additional months were sampled in some years.\n    Most surveys target open channels although the Fish Restoration\n    Program samples in or near shallow tidal wetlands. Three size\n    classes of zooplankton are targeted by these sampling programs with\n    different net mesh sizes: micro zooplankton (copepods and rotifers)\n    are targeted with a 43 \u00b5m mesh net, meso zooplankton (copepods and\n    cladocerans) are targeted with 150 - 160 \u00b5m mesh nets, and macro\n    zooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with 500-505 \u00b5m mesh\n    nets. We have integrated data from all 7 surveys and 3 size classes\n    into a powerful long-term record of zooplankton in the San Francisco\n    Estuary, representing over 80,000 zooplankton samples and over 2\n    billion estimated zooplankton captured by the nets in these surveys.\n    Over the duration of this zooplankton dataset, the zooplankton\n    community species composition has almost completely turned over\n    after a series of species invasions from East Asia, numerous drought\n    cycles have come and gone, and important fish species have\n    dramatically declined during the Pelagic Organism Decline in 2002,\n    likely due in part to reduced food supply from zooplankton. Data\n    from the individual surveys have been used in prior studies to\n    investigate issues related to species invasions, flows, fish diets\n    and population dynamics, zooplankton population dynamics, and\n    community ecology. Our integrated dataset offers new and\n    unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution to address these and other\n    questions with greater statistical power.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina; Battey, Morgan; Perry, Sarah; California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Hartman, Rosemary; Sherman, Stacy; Contreras, Dave; Ellis, Daniel; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Slater, Steven; Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Kwan, Nicole; Schultz, Andrew; Kalmbach, Andrew; California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 2023-03-09.

            "description": " Ice provides a range of ecosystem services, including fish harvest,\n  cultural traditions, transportation, recreation, and regulation of the\n  hydrologic cycle, to more than half of the world's 117 million lakes.\n  One of the earliest observed impacts of climatic warming has been the\n  loss of freshwater ice, with corresponding climatic and ecological\n  consequences. However, while trends in ice cover phenology have been\n  widely documented, a comprehensive large-scale assessment of lake ice\n  loss is absent. Here, using observations from 513 lakes around the\n  Northern Hemisphere, we identify lakes vulnerable to ice-free winters.\n  Our analyses reveal the importance of air temperature, lake depth,\n  elevation, and shoreline complexity in governing ice cover. We\n  estimate that 14,800 lakes currently experience intermittent winter\n  ice cover, increasing to 35,300 and 230,400 at 2degC and 8degC,\n  respectively, impacting up to 394 and 656 million people. Our study\n  illustrates that an extensive loss of lake ice will occur within the\n  next generation, stressing the importance of climate mitigation\n  strategies to preserve ecosystem structure and function, as well as\n  local winter cultural heritage.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSharma, Sapna; Blagrave, Kevin; Magnuson, John; O'Reilly, Catherine; Oliver, Samantha; Batt, Ryan; Magee, Madeline; Straile, Dietmar; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa; Winslow, Luke; Woolway, R.. 2018-12-13.

            "description": " This data publication includes code and results from a systematic literature review on the current state of near-term forecasting of freshwater quality. The review aimed to address the following questions: (1) Freshwater variables, scales, models, and skill: Which freshwater variables and temporal scales are most commonly targeted for near-term forecasts, and what modeling methods are most commonly employed to develop these forecasts? How is the accuracy of freshwater quality forecasts assessed, and how accurate are they? How is uncertainty typically incorporated into water quality forecast output? (2) Forecast infrastructure and workflows: Are iterative, automated workflows commonly employed in near-term freshwater quality forecasting? How are forecasts validated and archived? (3) Human dimensions: What is the stated motivation for development of most near-term freshwater quality forecasts, and who are the most common end users (if any)? How are end users engaged in forecast development? An initial search was conducted for published papers presenting freshwater quality forecasts from 1 January 2017 to 17 February 2022 in the Web of Science Core Collection. Results were subsequently analyzed in three stages. First, paper titles were screened for relevance. Second, an initial screen was conducted to assess whether each paper presented a near-term freshwater quality forecast. Third, papers that passed the initial screen were analyzed using a standardized matrix to assess the state of near-term freshwater quality forecasting and identify areas of recent progress and ongoing challenges. Additional details regarding the systematic literature search and review are presented in the Methods section of the metadata.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLofton, Mary; Howard, Dexter; Thomas, R.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019). Note that the genetic data provided here may be included in other data repositories.

            "description": " The objective of this study was to assess the relative distributions\n  of non-native resident fishes occurring in littoral habitats during\n  the drought year of 2014 within the western and northern portion of\n  California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), USA. A number of\n  non-native resident fish species (e.g., black bass, Micropterus spp.)\n  in the Delta have undergone remarkable increases in density in the\n  early 2000s and they are potential predators of endangered native\n  fishes such as Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Delta\n  Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The Delta makes up the tidal\n  freshwater portion of the San Francisco Estuary in California;\n  however, the critically dry year of 2014 caused a considerable\n  intrusion of salinity field within this region and may have caused a\n  shift in the resident fish community. To evaluate the response of\n  non-native resident fishes to this salinity intrusion, a boat\n  electrofishing survey was conducted in November of 2014 in the western\n  and northern part of the Delta by the United States Fish and Wildlife\n  Service, Lodi, California Office as part of the Interagency Ecological\n  Program for the San Francisco Estuary. Replicate sampling was done for\n  each site in this study in order to account for false zeroes through\n  the estimation of capture probability.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP); Speegle, Jonathan; Kirsch, Joseph; Mahardja, Brian. 2019-10-23.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program San Francisco Estuary Smelt Larva Survey was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in 2009 to monitor the distribution and abundance of newly hatched Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) in the San Francisco Estuary. Surveys are conducted bi-weekly, and sampling begins in December and continues through mid-March. The surveys sample at fixed stations, from San Pablo Bay through Suisun Bay and into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Napa River stations were added in 2014 and the San Pablo Bay expansion stations were added in December 2022. Each survey currently consists of 59 stations. At each station, one 10 minute stepped-oblique (bottom to top) tow is made following a prescribed tow schedule. The net is a conical 500 \u00b5m mesh lashed to a D shaped frame mounted on skis. Larval fish samples are preserved in the field in 10% Formalin and brought back to the CDFW Stockton Lab for identification to species and enumeration under a microscope. Several types of data are collected at each station in addition to the larval fish sample, including the volume of water sampled by the net, surface water temperature, surface and bottom specific conductance (EC normalized at 25\u02daC), Secchi disk depth, tow duration, tidal condition, and surface water turbidity.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBrennan, Colin; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica. 2025-06-05.

            "description": " Submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) has become widespread in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), and the diverse SAV assemblage is dominated by non-native species. SAV negatively impacts this estuarine ecosystem by impeding flows needed for water delivery and flood control, degrading habitat needed by native species, increasing breeding habitat for disease-vectoring mosquitoes, harboring non-native predatory fish, and hindering water recreation. The goal of this published integrated dataset is to facilitate study of these impacts. This data set includes four surveys conducted in the region during 2008-2021. Two of these are short-term special studies that have been completed, and two are ongoing long-term annual surveys. The nearshore survey of SAV and largemouth bass was conducted by the University of California-Davis (UC-Davis) at sites across the Delta during 2008-2010. The Aquatic Weed Control Action was completed by the Department of Water Resources as part of the Delta Smelt Resiliency Strategy and included monthly surveys of four sites during 2017-2018. The ongoing survey of Franks Tract is conducted annually by the SePRO corporation and the Division of Boating and Waterways, and available data are from 2014-2021. The ongoing annual survey conducted by the UC-Davis Center for Spatial Technologies and Remote Sensing covers many areas of the Delta and spans 2007-2008 and 2014-2021. Additional data from these ongoing surveys and data from other surveys will be added in subsequent versions of this data set.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nRasmussen, Nick; Rasmussen, Nick; Conrad, Louise; Green, Heather; Khanna, Shruti; Wright, Hailey; Caudill, Jeffrey; Gilbert, Patricia; Hoffmann, Krista; Lesmeister, Sarah; Khanna, Shruti; Ustin, Susan; Lay, Mui; Andrew, Margaret; Santos, Maria; Hestir, Erin; Shapiro, Kristen; Bellvert, Joaquim; Greenberg, Jonathan. 2023-03-22.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Fall Midwater Trawl Survey (FMWT) is a long-term monitoring survey conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and has sampled annually since its inception in 1967, with the exceptions of 1974 and 1979, when sampling was not conducted. The FMWT was initiated to determine the relative abundance and distribution of age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) in the San Francisco Estuary (California, United States), but the data has also been used for other upper estuary pelagic species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), American Shad (Alosa sapidissima), Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), and Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense). The FMWT currently samples 130 stations each month from September to December and a subset of this data is used to calculate an annual abundance index. These 130 stations range from San Pablo Bay upstream to Stockton on the San Joaquin River, and West Sacramento on the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. FMWT sampling data includes 193 unique station locations throughout the San Francisco Estuary; 63 are not currently sampled.  Most stations no longer sampled occur in South and Central San Francisco Bay (1968-1979), with others located in San Pablo Bay and upstream into the Delta. There are catch records for stations that were sampled only once. Data users are encouraged to look at station frequency over time to understand when and where sampling occurred. Sampling takes approximately 14 days per month to complete. Historically, FMWT sampling occasionally began as early as July (1972) or August (1968-1973, 1993-1994, 1996-1997) and sometimes continued past December to March (1968-1973, 1978, 1991-2001) or beyond (1992-1995). The Spring Midwater Trawl (SMWT) was a modified survey created to continue sampling January-March to track movements of mature adult delta smelt from 1991-2001. SMWT was replaced in 2002 with the more effective Spring Kodiak Trawl (SKT). All fish, shrimp, and jellyfish are identified and enumerated. In addition, the crew measures water temperature (\u00b0C), specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm), Secchi depth, and Turbidity (NTU). FMWT also currently collects meso- (copepods and cladocerans) and macro- (mysids and amphipods) zooplankton samples at 35 stations. Midwater and zooplankton tows conducted by FMWT allow for determination of available zooplankton prey resources. FMWT equipment and methods have remained consistent since the survey's inception, which allows annual abundance indices to be compared across time. Monthly and annual abundance indices are calculated using catch data from 100 \u201cindex\u201d stations grouped into 14 regional \u201careas\u201d. Monthly indices are calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for all 14 areas. Annual abundance indices are the sum of the 4 (September-December) monthly indices.  The FMWT catch data has been used to meet permit obligations to the State Water Resources Control Board (SW and DRCB) via Water Rights Decisions (D-1485 and D-1641) and USFWS-NMFS biological opinions for Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), and for incidental take permits issued by CDFW for operation of Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP).

            "description": " The Sierra Lakes Inventory Project (SLIP) was a research endeavor that ran from 1995-2002 and has supported research and management of Sierra Nevada aquatic ecosystems and their terrestrial interfaces. We described the physical characteristics of and surveyed aquatic communities for > 8,000 lentic water bodies in the southern Sierra Nevada, including lakes, ponds, marshes, and meadows. We also created digital map layers for these water bodies when such layers did not exist. The original objective of SLIP was to describe impacts of non-native fish on lake communities, but SLIP data has subsequently enabled study of additional ecological issues, including regional amphibian declines and their impacts on communities, and impacts of non-native fish on terrestrial species. In addition, these data are being used to develop fish removal efforts to restore aquatic ecosystems and recover endangered amphibians. The SLIP data is stored in a relational database that collectively describes water bodies (e.g., depth, elevation, location), surveys (conditions, effort), and communities (including approximately 170 fish, amphibian, reptile, benthic macroinvertebrate, and zooplankton taxa).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nKnapp, Roland; Pavelka, Claire; Hegeman, Ericka; Smith, Thomas. 2020-12-11.

            "description": " The photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll-a is a commonly measured index of phytoplankton biomass and water quality across all aquatic ecosystem types. Some monitoring and research programs have sustained chlorophyll-a measurements for decades at monthly or higher frequency. Each of these time series is an invaluable record of phytoplankton variability at a particular location. The  patterns of that variability have been essential for identifying the underlying processes of phytoplankton change at time scales of days, months, seasons, years and decades. Multidecadal series are rare and valuable because they provide empirical records of phytoplankton changes over the recent decades of unprecedented global change. These records also provide an empirical basis for comparing patterns and rates of change across geographic regions and ecosystem types. This data package contains multidecadal time series of measured chlorophyll-a concentration in three ecosystem types: 134 freshwater lakes (including a small number of reservoirs) that do not freeze; 78 high latitude lakes that do freeze; and 176 coastal ecosystems defined as water bodies where freshwater and seawater mix, including estuaries, coastal bays and lagoons, tidal rivers, and the Baltic Sea. Although there are other published compilations of chlorophyll-a time series, this package was compiled specifically to report observations made at monthly or higher frequency and sustained over multiple decades. The mean time series duration in this package is 33 years, and the mean number of sampling dates per site was 503 (range 186 to 2381). Thus, this data package provides an empirical basis for analyses to measure and compare decadal-scale patterns and rates of phytoplankton biomass variability between inland lakes and water bodies at the land-ocean interface. All chl-a measurements reported here were accessed from published repositories, except these four sites.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "title": "DRIFteRS (DRift Invertebrates For salmonids in River Systems): A dataset of drift invertebrate densities in streams and rivers across western North America, 1997\u20132024",
            "description": " Prey availability is among the most influential and highly variable determinants of fish growth and freshwater habitat carrying capacity, yet it remains understudied compared to physical habitat variables (Rosenfeld et al. 2014; Weber et al. 2017; Ouellet et al. 2025). We often lack a clear understanding of how much food is available to fishes, how it varies among habitats, and how it influences responses to restoration (Wipfli et al. 2010; Ouellet et al. 2025; Rossi et al. 2024). Drift invertebrates\u2014the primary food source for juvenile salmonids and other drift-foraging fishes\u2014play a pivotal role in these dynamics. To better understand the spatial and temporal variability of drift invertebrate abundance and biomass across the freshwater range of juvenile salmonids in western North America, we compiled the DRIFteRS dataset (DRift Invertebrates For salmonids in River Systems). The dataset encompasses 6,160 samples of drift invertebrates collected from 1,360 reaches on 456 unique rivers and streams spanning 55 river basins considered hydrologically independent  (i.e., not nested within the same larger watershed), including iconic systems like the Columbia, Fraser, and Colorado rivers, across Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Sample sites represent a diverse array of river and stream habitats (e.g., headwater, mainstem, side channel), in watersheds with diverse land uses (e.g., urban, wilderness, agricultural), and disturbance histories (e.g., fire, restoration). Collected between 1997 and 2024, the data span the full calendar year and capture daily and seasonal patterns in drift abundance and biomass densities. When paired with remotely sensed environmental landscape data, such as land use / land cover, climate, and disturbance history, and other relevant reach-scale covariates, such as water temperature, canopy cover, riparian vegetation composition, and channel and valley type, the DRIFteRS dataset can aid in identifying  key drivers of drift invertebrate densities and support predictive modeling in unsampled locations and times.  In addition to its primary relevance for salmonid conservation, the dataset may also inform broader investigations of food web connectivity, cross-ecosystem energy transfer, and ecosystem responses to landscape-scale environmental change. For salmonid-focused applications, the dataset can be integrated into habitat evaluation models, including bioenergetic (e.g., Naman et al. 2019) and life cycle models (e.g., Beechie et al. 2023), to improve estimates of habitat capacity for juvenile salmonids.  Understanding the dynamics of prey availability will become increasingly important since metabolic rates and thus food requirements of juvenile salmonids are likely to increase with projected rising water temperatures (Crozier et al. 2010). Flow regime transitions (i.e., snow or glacier dominated to rain dominated; Beechie et al. 2013), wildfire frequency and intensity (Hessburg et al 2021), as well as plant community and phenology shifts (Cleland et al. 2007; Franklin et al. 2016) are all predicted to change with rising temperatures and are potential drivers of aquatic prey quality and availability. These insights can ultimately inform restoration prioritization and design, helping managers consider food resource implications when evaluating restoration priorities and match habitat improvement to food supply.

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "description": " Central Valley Chinook Salmon populations differ in their Endangered Species Act listing status. It is often difficult to distinguish individuals from the different Evolutionarily Significant Units. As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation. This project supports recommendations from the Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s Salmon and Sturgeon Assessment of Indicators by Life Stage and Interagency Ecological Program Science Agenda efforts to improve Central Valley salmonid monitoring (Johnson et al. 2017; IEP 2019).

            "description": " This data set contains long-term limnology data from Castle Lake (located 5440 ft above sea level in Northern California). The data contained can be broadly grouped into two different types: chemical and physical data. This data set contains dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, chlorophyll-a concentration, CDOM, phycocyanin concentration, conductivity, specific conductivity, pH, salinity, water temperature, pressure, turbidity, sea pressure, density anomaly, and speed of sound at various depths. Sampling Frequency: Continuous measurements were made and recorded down to milliseconds. Sampling dates vary from year to year, starting as early as February and as late as November. This data collection is part of an ongoing project funded by the US National Science Foundation, private donors, US AID, and the University of Nevada's Global Water Center. This package was updated in February 2023 with data from 2021 and 2022. Dissolved O2 concentration data in the 2020 data file was updated to values in units of mg/L instead of umol/L and specific conductivity units in all files was revised to be in microSiemens per centimeter and not milliSiemens per centimeter.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nChandra, Sudeep; Suenaga, Erin; Scordo, Facundo; Daniel, Tyler. 2023-02-28.

            "description": " The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. DATA CORRECTION/UPDATE: Previous data versions 244.6, 244.7, and 244.8 contained an error and resulted in duplicated records of hatchery Chinook Salmon in the datasets. These datasets were removed from the data repository and the error was corrected in version 244.9 and after.

These estimates are generated through machine learning models on in-lake water quality matchups from LAGOS-US LIMNO with Landsat 5, 7, and 8 whole lake median reflectance values and pixel-wise band ratios that are subsequently used to make predictions across the U.S. The LANDSAT module contains remotely sensed reflectance values for 136,977 of the 137,465 lakes \u2265 4 ha from the LAGOS-US research platform. Within the module are a total of 45,867,023 sets of reflectance values, a matchup dataset with a window of up to 7 calendar days with in situ data, and associated water quality parameter predictions for each reflectance set. Additional quality control flags are provided for predictions indicating whether reflectance extractions included negative values, the percent of the maximum pixels ever retrieved for that lake that the predictions are based on, and whether there are shared calendar day predictions due to scene overlap.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHanly, Patrick; Webster, Katherine; Soranno, Patricia. 2024-10-30.

            "description": " Climate change and other anthropogenic stressors have led to long-term changes in the thermal structure, including surface temperatures, deepwater temperatures, and vertical thermal gradients, in many lakes around the world. Though many studies highlight warming of surface water temperatures in lakes worldwide, less is known about long-term trends in full vertical thermal structure and deepwater temperatures, which have been changing less consistently in both direction and magnitude. Here, we present a globally-expansive data set of summertime in-situ vertical temperature profiles from 153 lakes, with one time series beginning as early as 1894. We also compiled lake geographic, morphometric, and water quality variables that can influence vertical thermal structure through a variety of potential mechanisms in these lakes. These long-term time series of vertical temperature profiles and corresponding lake characteristics serve as valuable data to help understand changes and drivers of lake thermal structure in a time of rapid global and ecological change.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPilla, Rachel; Mette, Elizabeth; Williamson, Craig; Adamovich, Boris; Adrian, Rita; Anneville, Orlane; Balseiro, Esteban; Ban, Syuhei; Chandra, Sudeep; Colom-Montero, William; Devlin, Shawn; Dix, Margaret; Dokulil, Martin; Feldsine, Natalie; Feuchtmayr, Heidrun; Fogarty, Natalie; Gaiser, Evelyn; Girdner, Scott; Gonz\u00e1lez, Mar\u00eda; Hambright, K; Hamilton, David; Havens, Karl; Hessen, Dag; Hetzenauer, Harald; Higgins, Scott; Huttula, Timo; Huuskonen, Hannu; Isles, Peter; Joehnk, Klaus; Keller, Wendel; Klug, Jen; Knoll, Lesley; Korhonen, Johanna; Korovchinsky, Nikolai; K\u00f6ster, Oliver; Kraemer, Benjamin; Leavitt, Peter; Leoni, Barbara; Lepori, Fabio; Lepskaya, Ekaterina; Lottig, Noah; Luger, Martin; Maberly, Stephen; MacIntyre, Sally; McBride, Chris; McIntyre, Peter; Melles, Stephanie; Modenutti, Beatriz; M\u00fcller-Navarra, D\u00f6rthe; Pacholski, Laura; Paterson, Andrew; Pierson, Don; Pislegina, Helen; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis; Richardson, David; Rimmer, Alon; Rogora, Michela; Rogozin, Denis; Rusak, Jim; Rusanovskaya, Olga; Sadro, Steve; Salmaso, Nico; Saros, Jasmine; Sarvala, Jouko; Saulnier-Talbot, \u00c9milie; Schindler, Daniel; Shimaraeva, Svetlana; Silow, Eugene; Sitoki, Lewis; Sommaruga, Ruben; Straile, Dietmar; Strock, Kristin; Swain, Hilary; Tallant, Jason; Thiery, Wim; Timofeyev, Maxim; Tolomeev, Alexander; Tominaga, Koji; Vanni, Michael; Verburg, Piet; Vinebrooke, Rolf; Wanzenb\u00f6ck, Josef; Weathers, Kathleen; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa; Zadereev, Egor; Zhukova, Tatyana. 2022-09-13.

            "description": " The Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring Program (EDSM) was initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016. The main purpose of EDSM is to provide information about endemic Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) population sizes and distributions within the upper San Francisco Estuary. To track the life cycle of this annual species, larval trawling with a fine-mesh (20 mm) net is conducted during the spring months, and Kodiak trawling for juveniles and adults occurs during the summer, fall, and winter months. Sampling sites are chosen via a stratified random sampling design. A minimum of two tows are conducted at each site, and field staff typically sample between 18 and 41 sites weekly. All fish collected are identified and enumerated, and a subset are measured for body length. Environmental data (water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, depth) are also measured. In addition to Hypomesus spp., this long-term monitoring dataset can also be useful in evaluating the status and trends of other species of interest, especially pelagic fishes.

            "description": " Quantifying and predicting precipitation and water flow, and their influence on ecosystems is challenged by the dynamic relationships between and timing of precipitation and water fluxes. To help with these challenges, scientists use \u201cwater year\u201d to examine and predict the impacts of precipitation and relevant extreme climatic and hydrological events on ecosystems. However, traditional water year definitions used in the U.S. have limited considerations of areal variations in climate and hydrology, which need to be considered when studying ecosystems at regional or national scales. We developed local water year (LWY) values that consider spatial variation using existing definitions whereby the water year begins in the month with the lowest or highest average monthly streamflow. We employed a spatial interpolation technique to assign the start and end months of two LWY timeframes to 202 subregions across the conterminous U.S. that range from 4,384 to 134,755 km 2\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSun, Xinyu; Cheruvelil, Kendra. 2025-02-17.

            "description": " Data on fall (September-December) age-0 abundances of a suite of relatively abundant/common fishes and a suite of likely environmental driver variables. All data are derived from publicly available sources as cited below, except for determination of age-0 maximum length thresholds, which were derived from examination of length-frequency histograms for fall months. Fish data are from https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/0cdf7e5e954be1798ab9bf4f23816e83. Water temperature, chlorophyll-a, and Secchi depth data are from https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/42b3d889ffa056030f953aed85b5621e. Zooplankton abundance data are from (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/89dbadd9d9dbdfc804b160c81633db0d). Sea surface temperature data are from (https://doi.org/10.6075/J0S75GHD). Ocean upwelling data are from (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/upwelling/dnld). Flows data are from the DAYFLOW model (https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/dayflow). Environmental driver data are annualized by water year and, where appropriate, aggregated to a single, putatively spatially representative time series.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nWalter, Jonathan; Bashevkin, Samuel; Gaeta, Jereme; Nguyen, Trinh; Mitchell, Lara; Khanna, Shruti; Bashevkin, Samuel; Bosworth, David; Perry, Sarah; Stumpner, Elizabeth; Hartman, Rosemary; Bashevkin, Samuel; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina. 2024-09-20.

Short-term research projects on benthic invertebrates composition and a bathymetric map can also be found within the data package. Ecological, watershed and climatological measurements taken characterize the limnology of Castle Lake, a pristine glacial cirque that is the largest (by volume) of the 25 alpine and sub-alpine lake within the larger Upper Sacramento River Watershed. Sampling Frequency: Varies depending on survey conducted. During summer months- multiple times during each month. Less frequent during winter months.

            "description": " Lake surface temperatures are steadily increasing. DO responds to temperature through\n        multiple mechanisms, suggesting that DO in lakes should be responding to changing water\n        temperatures. To determine whether and how DO is changing in temperate lakes, we collected\n        and analyzed 22,983 temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles from approximately 400 mostly\n        temperate zone lakes. Here, we present resulting derived statistics from this analysis.\n        These statistics include mean summer epilimnetic temperature and DO, hypolimnetic\n        temperature and DO, Secchi depth, chlorophyll a, as well as select meteorological variables\n        such as mean summer air temperature and wind speed.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nJane, Stephen; Hansen, Gretchen; Benjamin, Kraemer; Leavitt, Peter; Mincer, Joshua; North, Rebecca; Pilla, Rachel; Stetler, Jonathan; Williamson, Craig; Woolway, R.

            "title": "Lake exposure to wildfire smoke in North America, 2019-2021",
            "description": " Wildfire activity is increasing globally. The resulting smoke plumes can travel hundreds to thousands of kilometers, reflecting or scattering sunlight and depositing ash within ecosystems. Several key physical, chemical, and biological processes in lakes are controlled by factors affected by smoke. The spatial and temporal scales of lake exposure to smoke are extensive and underrecognized. We introduce the concept of the lake smoke-day, or the number of days any given lake is exposed to smoke in any given fire season, and quantify the total lake smoke-day exposure in North America from 2019-2021. Because smoke can be transported at continental to intercontinental scales, even regions that may not typically experience direct burning of landscapes by wildfire are at risk of smoke exposure. We found that 99.3% of North America was covered by smoke, affecting a total of 1,333,687 lakes >=10 ha. An incredible 98.9% of lakes experienced at least 10 smoke-days a year, with 89.6% of lakes receiving over 30 lake smoke-days, and lakes in some regions experiencing up to 4 months of cumulative smoke-days. Herein we review the mechanisms through which smoke and ash can affect lakes by altering the amount and spectral composition of incoming solar radiation and depositing carbon, nutrients, or toxic compounds that could alter chemical conditions and impact biota. We develop a conceptual framework that synthesizes known and theoretical impacts of smoke on lakes to guide future research. Finally, we identify emerging research priorities that can help us better understand how lakes will be affected by smoke as wildfire activity increases due to climate change and other anthropogenic activities.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFarruggia, Mary; Brahney, Janice; Tanentzap, Andrew; Brentrup, Jennifer; Brighenti, Ludmila; Chandra, Sudeep; Cort\u00e9s, Alicia; Fernandez, Rocio; Fischer, Janet; Forrest, Alexander; Jin, Yufang; Larrieu, Kenneth; McCullough, Ian; Oleksy, Isabella; Pilla, Rachel; Rusak, James; Scordo, Facundo; Smits, Adrianne; Symons, Celia; Tang, Minmeng; Woodman, Samuel; Sadro, Steven. 2024-05-01.

            "description": " The concentration of oxygen dissolved in water regulates many aspects of aquatic ecosystems, including habitat suitability for biota, greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient cycling, and metal toxicity. However, little is known about how dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in lakes are changing through time. The solubility of oxygen in water declines with increasing water temperatures, but other temperature-sensitive processes may suppress or amplify trends through time, making long-term observations essential to understanding DO dynamics and trends. This dataset includes measurements of dissolved oxygen and temperature from greater than 400 widely geographically-distributed lakes, as well as a suite of associated measurements in or around many of the lakes, including watershed land use, water clarity, limiting nutrient concentrations, and chlorophyll concentrations. Analysis of these data reveal widespread losses in dissolved oxygen through time in both surface and deep waters.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStetler, Jonathan; Jane, Stephen; Mincer, Joshua; Sanders, Maya; Rose, Kevin; Lead PI, NTL; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Lead PI, NTL; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Williamson, Craig; Vanni, Michael; Gonzalez, Maria; Renwick, William; Lead PI, NTL; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Lead PI, NTL; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Sadro, Steve; Sadro, Steve; Messager, Mathis; Chandra, Sudeep; Leach, Taylor; Schmid, Martin; Schmid, Martin; Jenny, Jean-Philippe; Jenny, Jean-Philippe; Matsuzaki, Shin-Ichiro. 2024-05-25.

            "description": " Overview The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) funds habitat improvement work and associated monitoring in the Central Valley of California to increase salmonid populations in furtherance of meeting CVPIA fish doubling goals. This data package contains two datasets for White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) monitoring in the San Joaquin River (SJR) conducted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Lodi Fish and Wildlife Office. The objective of this sampling to was determine if White Sturgeon were spawning in the San Joaquin River and to explore where and when spawning occurred, within areas where adult White Sturgeon were known to congregate during the suspected spawning season. SJR_Egg_WST_Set Data This dataset contains data on egg mat sets used to document White Sturgeon spawning in the San Joaquin River. Sets were made at non-random locations from February to May in 2011-2018. In 2017, additional \u201cblitz\u201d sets were used in areas where eggs were detected. Details about set location, timing, and environmental conditions are included, along with the total number eggs of White Sturgeon and other non-sturgeon eggs. SJR_Egg_WST_Catch Data This dataset contains data specific to eggs found in egg mat nets in the San Joaquin River. Across all years, the diameter of eggs (or groups of eggs) were recorded.  In 2011 and 2012, efforts were made to describe the developmental stage of White Sturgeon eggs and estimates of spawning timing were sometimes calculated.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service; Steinhart, Geoff. 2024-01-23.

This data set comprises one of the largest and most complete sets of measurements of underwater ultraviolet (UV) transparency available in the world. The data include a suite of 36 variables, with a focus on the optical characteristics. Lakes range from pristine natural lakes to manmade reservoirs. The systems represented in this data set are largely located in North America, from the northeastern United States to Alaska, and alpine and subalpine lakes in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada. Lakes included range from iconic Lake Tahoe, and Castle Lake in northern California, to lakes in the South American Patagonian region, as well as New Zealand. Data were most often collected during the summer, and in some lakes span multiple years (with year-round data since 2006 in Lake Tahoe). The data here are contained in four files, including LakeData.csv, SiteInformation.csv, Methods.csv, and Variables.csv. The main data are in LakeData.csv. SiteInformation.csv, Methods.csv, and Variables.csv support the main data file with descriptions of the sampling sites, methods by which samples were processed, and descriptions of the variables that were measured, respectively. This data set complements the site-intensive limnological data that we published in EDI on 30+ years of data from 3 lakes in the Poconos Mountains region of Pennsylvania, USA.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Summer Townet Survey (STN) and Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) are two long-term monitoring projects conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to monitor fish abundance and distribution trends in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) since 1959 and 1967, respectively. Starting in 2005, zooplankton monitoring was added and paired with fish tows to investigate food availability for young fishes. Food limitation has been a long-term issue and a focus of the Pelagic Organism Decline (POD) studies that began in 2005. By 2011, STN routinely conducted zooplankton monitoring at 40 stations, and FMWT at 32 stations in the upper SFE from Carquinez Strait to the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel and into the South Delta. STN samples every other week from June to August and FMWT samples once monthly from September to December. Both projects collect mesozooplankton samples using a modified Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net to target copepods and cladocerans, and FMWT also samples macrozooplankton (i.e. mysids and amphipods) using a mysid net. Flowmeters are used to measure the volume sampled to determine zooplankton catch per unit effort. Environmental variables such as water temperature, turbidity, secchi, and electrical conductivity are collected with each zooplankton sample. Concurrent fish and zooplankton tows conducted by STN and FMWT have allowed for comparisons of fish diet to the available zooplankton prey at the time of collection.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBreining-Aday, Spencer; Slater, Steven; Burdi, Christina. 2025-01-02.

            "description": " The Nutrient Network (NutNet) is a globally coordinated research initiative aimed at investigating the impacts of human-induced changes in nutrient availability and consumer presence on grassland ecosystems. In this study, we used data from 79 grassland sites participating in NutNet, which includes a factorial experiment involving herbivory exclusion and/or nutrient addition. Standardized methodologies were applied across all sites to facilitate direct comparisons of response variables. We used ecosystem variables to quantify three provisioning ecosystem services (forage quantity, forage chemical quality, and forage physical quality), three supporting services (forage stability, soil fertility, and soil stability), and eight regulating services (erosion control, control of soil acidification, regulation of water quantity and quality, carbon storage, resistance to plant invasion, pest control, and pollination). Additionally, we identified three plant biodiversity variables that are closely related to the provisioning of ecosystem services (alpha richness, beta diversity, and native diversity). Using this data, we quantified key ecosystem services provided by rangelands, assessed both short- and long-term impacts of grazing exclusion and fertilization on these services, and identified synergies and trade-offs between them.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBorer, Elizabeth; Adler, Peter; Alberti, Juan; Asmus, Ashley; Bakker, Jonathan; Bakker, Liesbeth; Blumenthal, Dana; Brudvig, Lars; Bruschetti, Carlos; Buckley, Yvonne; Caldeira, Maria; Campana, Sof\u00eda; Carbutt, Clinton; Catford, Jane; Cleland, Elsa; Collins, Scott; Cottingham, Kathryn; Damschen, Ellen; Dickson, Tim; Donohue, Ian; Elgersma, Kenneth; Eskelinen, Anu; Estrada, Catalina; Gruner, Daniel; G\u00fcsewell, Sabine; Hagenah, Nicole; Jamiyansharav, Khishigbayar; J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, Ingibj\u00f6rg Svala; Knops, Johannes; Komatsu, Kimberly; Laanisto, Lauri; Laungani, Ramesh; Leakey, Andrew; Lekberg, Ylva; Lind, Eric; MacDougall, Andrew; Martina, Jason; McCulley, Rebecca; Mitchell, Charles; Moore, Joslin; Morgan, John; Mortensen, Brent; O'Halloran, Lydia; Ohlert, Timothy; Orrock, John; Pascual, Jes\u00fas; Peri, Pablo; Pichon, No\u00e9mie; Porath-Krause, Anita; Prober, Suzanne; Risch, Anita; Schuetz, Martin; Silveira, Maria; Slette, Ingrid; Smith, Nick; Smith, Melinda; Speziale, Karina; Stevens, Carly; Tedder, Michelle; Tognetti, Pedro; Veen, G.F.

            "description": " In times of a changing hydroclimate and growing human population, there is a need to assess how various climatic and demand conditions influence water availability on the landscape. Tendency for drought conditions is a prime example of a key hydroclimatic metric that is useful for understanding water retention in the surrounding landscape. However, merging drought climatological data with co-located aquatic data is challenging. To facilitate national-scale analyses of basin-level drought conditions (i.e., Palmer Drought Severity Index; PDSI) with co-located water quality data, we present aggregated PDSI data for the contiguous United States. Data are aggregated using the HydroBASINS basin shapefiles. HYBAS_ID is retained to enable merging with HydroBASINS parent datasets.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nMeyer, Michael; Lehner, Bernhard; Grill, G\u00fcnther; Abatzoglou, John. 2025-06-19.

            "description": " The lysimeter array is a collection of 105 snowmelt lysimeters that\n  collect discharge measurements at the base of the snowpack. Each\n  lysimeter is a polyethylene pan with 22 cm high vertical walls and 47\n  cm by 39.5 cm in horizontal extent resulting in a footprint area of\n  ~1,850 cm2. The height of the lysimeter walls prevent both the loss of\n  water out of the lysimeters and the influx of water from saturated\n  zones along the snow-soil interface [Kattelmann, 2000]. This location\n  collected data during spring snowmelt (April through July) for water\n  years 1998 through 2003. From 1998 through 2001, the array was\n  organized as a two meter grid nested within a four meter grid. The\n  1998 water year had only 36 lysimeters installed. In the 2002 water\n  year, 15 of lysimeters on the perimeter were relocated to increase the\n  density of the inner grid. Lysimeters were moved from locations of low\n  snow accumulation on the eastern edge and a region that collects\n  debris during melt on the western edge. Meltwater collected by the\n  lysimeters flowed to an underground laboratory through flexible PVC\n  piping into Rainwise Rainew Tipping Bucket Rain Gauges. The cumulative\n  number of tips were recorded by a Campbell Scientific CR1O data logger\n  at one hour intervals summed to daily totals for this dataset. The\n  precision of outflow is approximately 11 ml (~0.06 mm given the\n  footprint of the lysimeter). This dataset includes the coordinates for\n  each lysimeter of the Soddie lysimeter array. Coordinates are in UTM\n  projection, zone 13N, datum NAD83.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nWilliams, Mark; Webb, Ryan; Erickson, Tyler. 2018-12-18.

            "description": " Algae blooms in rivers are difficult to quantify due to high heterogeneity, deep and swift conditions, seasonally rapid changes, and the high amount of surveyor effort needed to document river conditions. The data presented here were used to test the extent that summer time series of daily metabolism data reflected the quantity and type of vegetation biomass in a highly productive river with variable primary producer assemblages. Two categories of data are included in this data release: 1) Daily ecosystem metabolism estimates (gross primary production, GPP, ecosystem respiration, ER, and net ecosystem production, NEP), and 2) Reach scale biomass of 3 vegetation assemblages. In addition to these data products, we include the input data used to estimate metabolism, which includes high frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and light. We also included the raw data used to estimate reach scale biomass, including measurements of filamentous algal and macrophyte percent cover and field samples analyzed for ash free dry mass, which were used to scale field observations of cover to reach scale biomass estimates. Metabolism and vegetation biomass data were collected at 11 reaches along the mid and lower Klamath River, California during summer 2019.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGenzoli, Laurel; Hall, Robert. 2025-07-02.

            "description": " We analyzed the thermal response in the upper mixed layer of a lake in\n  the Sierra Nevada of California to interannual variation in air\n  temperature, snow deposition, and other climate factors to\n  characterize relative effects on water temperature. We then use summer\n  temperature data from 19 lakes to understand how the relative\n  importance of snow and other factors governing lake temperature vary\n  at broad spatial scales and predict sensitivity to warming in over\n  1600 lakes across the region. Our study has three specific objectives:\n  1) to characterize how water temperatures in mountain lakes are\n  responding to variation in air temperature, snow deposition, and other\n  climate factors; 2) to evaluate scaling relationships for water\n  temperature using landscape and lake morphometric attributes; and 3)\n  using those scaling relationships, to identify lakes that are most\n  sensitive to warming from ongoing changes in climate. Our results\n  emphasize the high rate of climate warming taking place in mountain\n  ecosystems, and demonstrate the substantial role of snowpack in\n  governing lake temperature. We illustrate the extent to which warming\n  within lakes scales with elevation and lake morphometric attributes,\n  and use those empirical relationships to identify lakes most sensitive\n  to ongoing changes in climate.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSadro, Steve. 2018-08-16.

            "description": " This dataset contains data for soil physical and chemical properties of gypsum and non-gypsum soils in the northern Chihuahuan and eastern Mojave Deserts. Data were obtained from 20 study sites total, 10 located on soils derived from gypsum parent material and 10 located on soils derived from non-gypsum parent materials. Sites were grouped into 10 pairs, in which every gypsum site was partnered with a non-gypsum site located in the same region. Apart from soil type, partnered-site characteristics (topography, climate, elevation, slope, aspect, and presence of biocrusts) were held relatively constant. Site info and characteristics data can be accessed at knb-lter-jrn.210616001. Soil physical properties included: percent gravel, percent < 2mm fraction, soil aggregate stability, and soil compaction. Soil chemical properties were: percent gypsum content, pH, EC, and soil soluble concentrations of calcium, magnesium, potassium, sulfur, and phosphorus. The resulting soil data was used to understand physical and chemical differences between gypsum and non-gypsum soils and to examine how biocrust community types and moss species abundance and composition were associated with the measured soil variables. This study and dataset are complete.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGobbie, Katelyn; Pietrasiak, Nicole; Drenovsky, Rebecca. 2024-10-18.

            "description": " LakeBeD-US: Ecology Edition is a harmonized lake water quality dataset containing time series and vertical profiles of 21 lakes in the United States monitored by long-term monitoring institutions. These institutions include the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research program (NTL-LTER), Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research program (NWT-LTER), National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and the Carey Lab at Virginia Tech as part of the Virginia Reservoirs Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) site in collaboration with the Western Virginia Water Authority. The data include depth-discrete observations of 17 water quality variables including temperature, dissolved oxygen, chemical properties, Secchi depth, and more. Observations are divided into data collected by automated sensors at a relatively high temporal frequency and manually sampled data at a relatively low temporal frequency. All data were collected in situ. The data are available as Apache Parquet files, and the included R scripts give guidance on how to utilize and query the dataset in R. LakeBeD-US: Ecology Edition is an ecological science-oriented companion to LakeBeD-US: Computer Science Edition. The Computer Science Edition is available on the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nMcAfee, Bennett; Lofton, Mary; Breef-Pilz, Adrienne; Goodman, Keli; Hensley, Robert; Hoffman, Kathryn; Howard, Dexter; Lewis, Abigail; McKnight, Diane; Oleksy, Isabella; Wander, Heather; Carey, Cayelan; Karpatne, Anuj; Hanson, Paul; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Lottig, Noah; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Hart, Julia; Dugan, Hilary; Carey, Cayelan; Stanley, Emily; Hanson, Paul; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Carey, Cayelan; Lewis, Abigail; Breef-Pilz, Adrienne; Carey, Cayelan; Breef-Pilz, Adrienne; Delany, Austin; Carey, Cayelan; Breef-Pilz, Adrienne; Daneshmand, Vahid; Delany, Austin; Thomas, R.; Carey, Cayelan; Howard, Dexter; Hoffman, Kathryn; Wander, Heather; Breef-Pilz, Adrienne; Niederlehner, B.; Haynie, George; Keverline, Ryan; Kricheldorf, Michael; Tipper, Evelyn; Carey, Cayelan; Breef-Pilz, Adrienne; Hoffman, Kathryn; Niederlehner, Barbara; Haynie, George; Keverline, Ryan; Kricheldorf, Michael; Tipper, Evelyn; Carey, Cayelan; Breef-Pilz, Adrienne; Delany, Austin; Hounshell, Alexandria; Lewis, Abigail; Wander, Heather; Haynie, George; Kricheldorf, Michael; Tipper, Evelyn; McKnight, Diane M.; Yevak, Samuel; Dykema, Stephanie; Loria, Kelly; Mcknight, Diane; Johnson, Pieter; Loria, Kelly; Dykema, Stephanie; Johnson, Pieter; Yevak, Samuel; Dykema, Stephanie; Loria, Kelly; Johnson, Pieter; Yevak, Samuel; Dykema, Stephanie; Loria, Kelly; Johnson, Pieter; Yevak, Samuel; Dykema, Stephanie; Loria, Kelly; Johnson, Pieter T.J.; Yevak, Samuel E.; Dykema, Stephanie; Loria, Kelly A.; Carey, Cayelan; Breef-Pilz, Adrienne; Wander, Heather; Delany, Austin; Haynie, George; Keverline, Ryan; Kricheldorf, Michael; Tipper, Evelyn; Aho, Kelly; Maavara, Taylor; Cawley, Kaelin; Raymond, Peter; Baron, Jill; Caine, Nel; Carey, Cayelan; Lewis, Abigail; Howard, Dexter; Woelmer, Whitney; Gantzer, Paul; Bierlein, Kevin; Little, John; WVWA; Cory, Rose; McKnight, Diane; Chin, Yu-Ping; Miller, Penney; Jaros, Chris; Doubek, Jonathan; Campbell, Kylie; Doubek, Kaitlyn; Hamre, Kathleen; Lofton, Mary; McClure, Ryan; Ward, Nicole; Carey, Cayelan; Flanagan, Colleen; McKnight, Diane; Liptzin, Daniel; Williams, Mark; Miller, Matthew; Gaeta, Jereme; Hrabik, Thomas; Sass, Greg; Gilbert, Stephen; Vander Zanden, M Jake; Gerling, Alexandra; Browne, Richard; Gantzer, Paul; Mobley, Mark; Little, John; Carey, Cayelan; Lathrop, Richard; Johnson, B; Johnson, T; Vogelsang, M; Carpenter, Stephen; Hrabik, Thomas; Kitchell, J; Magnuson, John; Rudstam, Lars; Stewart, R; Lathrop, Richard; Carpenter, Stephen; Lawson, Zach; Vander Zanden, M.

Despite the importance of trophic state as a gauge of\n        lake water quality, standardized and machine readable observations are uncommon. Remote\n        sensing presents an opportunity to detect and analyze lake trophic state with reproducible,\n        robust methods across time and space. We used Landsat surface reflectance and lake\n        morphometric data to create the first compendium of lake trophic state for more than 56,000\n        lakes of at least 10 ha in size throughout the contiguous United States from 1984 through\n        2020. The dataset was constructed with FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible,\n        Interoperable, and Reproducible) in mind, where data are publicly available, relational keys\n        from parent datasets are retained, and all data wrangling and modeling routines are scripted\n        for future reuse. Together, this resource offers critical data to address basic and applied\n        research questions about lake water quality at a suite of spatial and temporal\n        scales.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nMeyer, Michael; Topp, Simon; King, Tyler; Ladwig, Robert; Pilla, Rachel; Dugan, Hilary; Eggleston, Jack; Hampton, Stephanie; Leech, Dina; Oleksy, Isabella; Ross, Jesse; Ross, Matthew; Woolway, R; Yang, Xiao; Brousil, Matthew; Fickas, Kate; Padowski, Julie; Pollard, Amina; Ren, Jianning; Zwart, Jacob. 2023-04-13.

            "description": " Understanding controls on primary productivity is essential for describing ecosystems and their responses to environmental change. Lake primary production is strongly controlled by inputs of nutrients and colored dissolved organic matter. While past studies have developed mathematical models of this nutrient-color paradigm, broad empirical tests of these models are scarce. We compiled data from 58 diverse and globally distributed and mostly temperate lakes to test such a model and improve understanding and prediction of the controls on lake primary production. These lakes varied widely in size (0.02-2300 km2), pelagic gross primary production (20-8000 mg C m-2 d-1), and other characteristics. The data package includes high-frequency dissolved oxygen, water temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation data as well as daily estimates of GPP and ER derived from those data. In addition, the data package includes median in-lake and stream concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and total phosphorus for a subset of 18 of those lakes.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nOleksy, Isabella; Solomon, Christopher; Jones, Stuart; Olson, Carly; Bertolet, Brittni; Adrian, Rita; Bansal, Sheel; Baron, Jill; Brothers, Soren; Chandra, Sudeep; Chou, Hsiu-Mei; Colom-Montero, William; Culpepper, Joshua; de Eyto, Elvira; Farragher, Matthew; Hilt, Sabine; Holeck, Kristen; Kazanjian, Garabet; Klaus, Marcus; Klug, Jennifer; K\u00f6hler, Jan; Laas, Alo; Lundin, Erik; Parkes, Alice; Rose, Kevin; Rudstam, Lars; Rusak, James; Scordo, Facundo; Vanni, Michael; Verburg, Piet; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily; Magnuson, John; Carpenter, Stephen; Stanley, Emily. 2024-12-20.

            "description": " Steelhead spawning surveys have been conducted on the Lower American River (LAR) for the years 2002-2005, 2007, and 2009-2024. These surveys in conjunction with annual escapement estimates to Nimbus Fish Hatchery, are used to provide a yearly index of in-river and over all spawning abundance. Reclamation\u2019s mission is to manage, develop and protect water and related resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner in the interest of the American people. In the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) most recent biological opinion (2009), the presence of dams was identified as the most influential stressor to steelhead on the American River because it blocks passage to historic spawning and rearing habitat. Thus, Reclamation is required to monitor the effects of flow regulation by dams on the steelhead life stages present in the river system. Congruently, Reclamation has committed to significant restoration actions including salmonid spawning and rearing habitat rehabilitation on the Lower American River, which also require accurate and robust monitoring. These surveys support the mission and monitoring requirements of Reclamation by collecting the spawning data required to effectively conduct analyses of the effects of regulating Folsom and Nimbus dams on this federally listed species\u2019 critical life stage development and support operational decision making.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSweeney, Jamie; Hannon, John. 2024-10-11.

            "description": " The Sacramento-San Joaquin Watershed, located in Central and Northern California, drains approximately 43,000 square miles and terminates at the Golden Gate Bridge. This watershed hosts numerous species of ecological, cultural, and recreational importance, including White (Acipenser transmontanus) and Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris). Sturgeon were severely overfished in the late 1800s and early 1900s, prompting a closure of the recreational and commercial sturgeon fishery in 1917 by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG; Now California Department of Fish and Wildlife, CDFW). The fishery remained closed until 1954, when a recreational fishery was once again allowed by the CDFG. A single year of surveying was conducted by the CDFG in 1954 to monitor the new fishery and a semi-regular survey was established in 1967. Since then, CDFW has systematically surveyed subadult and adult White and Green Sturgeon as part of the Adult Sturgeon Study, with annual surveys conducted between 2005 and 2022. Capturing adult sturgeon using 3.7m deep drifted trammel nets in areas including Suisun Bay, Grizzly Bay, and San Pablo Bay, these efforts have been supplemented by angler-contributed data, collected through mail returns and river/bay creel surveys. Tagging practices involve individually coded \u00bd\u201d Petersen-disk tags, with reward values introduced in 1974 to encourage angler cooperation and enhance tag return rate accuracy. The adoption of PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tags began in 2007 and has been consistently employed since 2019. These data provide insights into tag return rates, recaptures, and mortalities, supporting the estimation of abundance and harvest rates. This comprehensive dataset enriches our understanding of sturgeon population dynamics and is crucial for monitoring California sturgeon.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStompe, Dylan; Hobbs, James. 2024-11-14.

            "description": " The endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus is an osmerid fish endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary. A captive breeding program for the species led by the Fish Culture and Conservation Laboratory (FCCL), University of California, Davis, began in 1996 to create a refuge population. In order to better understand how captive Delta Smelt would fare in conditions outside of the hatchery, we placed captive-reared fish in enclosures in the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta, and evaluated their ability to survive, feed, and maintain condition. Fish were acclimated in the hatchery at FCCL, tagged, swabbed, weighed, measured, and transferred to enclosures in the field. There were three types of enclosures (n=2 for each type), varying in mesh size and wrap condition. In January 2019, 384 adult Delta Smelt (243 days post hatch) were transferred to enclosures in Rio Vista. In February 2019, 360 adult Delta Smelt (278 days post hatch) were transferred to enclosures in the Deepwater Shipping Channel. For each deployment, fish remained in enclosures for approximately one month, then were retrieved from enclosures, euthanized, identified, weighed and measured. A subset were also analyzed for diet contents. During the one-month long deployments, cages were checked for biofouling, damage, and dead fish, and water quality measurements and zooplankton samples were collected.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPien, Catarina; Kwan, Nicole; Schreier, Brian; Baerwald, Melinda. 2023-03-23.

            "description": " This dataset contains raw and calculated percent cover and frequency data for biological soil crust (hereafter biocrust) functional groups, vascular plant functional groups, and abiotic land surface features on and off gypsum soils in the northern Chihuahuan and eastern Mojave Deserts. Abundance data were obtained from 20 study sites total, 10 located on soils derived from gypsum parent material and 10 located on soils derived from non-gypsum parent materials. Sites were grouped into 10 pairs, in which every gypsum site was partnered with a non-gypsum site located in the same region. Apart from soil type, partnered-site characteristics (topography, climate, elevation, slope, aspect, and presence of biocrusts) were held relatively constant. At each site, cover and frequency assessments were made using the line-point intercept method (LPI) and frequency quadrats (1.0 m^2), respectively. Biocrust functional groups included the following crusts: lichen, moss, incipient algal, light algal, dark algal, unknown photosynthetic crust, and vagrant cyanobacteria. Vascular plant categories included: perennial forbs, perennial graminoids, annual forbs, annual graminoids, subshrub, shrub, Yucca, and cacti. Abiotic land surface features included: woody litter, herbaceous litter, bare soil, rock, bedrock, and animal feces. Moss crusts identified within cover and frequency analyses were sampled, and classified to species level via microscopy. The resulting percent cover and frequency data was used to understand differences in biocrust and moss species abundance and diversity on and off gypsum soils; furthermore, how biocrust and moss species abundance was associated with the measured environmental variables. Soil physical and chemical data from this study can be accessed at knb-lter-jrn.210616002. This study and dataset are complete.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGobbie, Katelyn; Drenovsky, Rebecca; Pietrasiak, Nicole. 2024-10-18.

            "description": " Extreme climatic events have increased in frequency globally, with a simultaneous surge in scientific interest about their ecological consequences, particularly in sensitive freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems. In this context, it is imperative that ecologists apply their expertise to understand and predict the ecological impacts of extreme events, and to collaborate across disciplines and sectors to improve socio-ecological resilience to extreme events. However, ecological research on extreme events is often opportunistic and hampered by lack of coordination, among ecologists and among interdisciplinary collaborators. We conducted a literature search to investigate the research approaches that ecologists use to study extreme events in aquatic ecosystems (including freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems), that is, to understand how, when, and where ecologists study these events, and to identify areas to improve research practices. We used keywords related to ecology, aquatic ecosystems, and types of extreme events to identify 215 relevant papers in the literature and we examined these papers to identify 49 studies that met our inclusion criteria of including observations of ecological responses to an extreme event occurring in an aquatic ecosystem. We then extracted information from the 49 included papers, including information on the ecosystem, the extreme event, the spatial and temporal approaches to sampling, the types of response variables sampled, and the magnitude of responses measured. This dataset collates research approaches to the study of extreme events in aquatic ecosystems at a broad scale. Based on this literature review, we identified key areas where aquatic ecologists can improve research practices, including prioritizing pre- and post-event data collection, leveraging long-term and cross-site monitoring networks, and adopting novel approaches to analysis, synthesis, and collaboration.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAoki, Lillian; Brisbin, Margaret; Hounshell, Alexandria; Kincaid, Dustin; Larson, Erin; Sansom, Brandon; Shogren, Arial; Smith, Rachel; Sullivan-Stack, Jenna. 2022-02-10.

            "description": " We conducted a study in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to determine efficacy of the widely used herbicide fluridone in an estuarine ecosystem. The primary goal of SAV removal was restoration of open water habitat for endangered Hypomesus transpacificus (Delta Smelt). Over 18 months and multiple sets of multi-week fluridone applications, we monitored concentrations of fluridone and responses by SAV across pairs of treated and reference sites. Fluridone concentrations in the water were generally below the 2-5 parts per billion required for SAV control. Monitoring demonstrated these low water concentrations were likely due to dissipation by tides, despite use of pelleted fluridone formulations marketed for flowing water environments. Fluridone did, however, accumulate in sediment at concentrations hundreds of times higher than those measured in the water. Nonetheless, we did not observe lasting reductions in SAV abundance or changes in SAV community composition. By demonstrating lack of efficacy of one of the few herbicides permitted for use in this estuary, this study highlights the need for development of SAV management tools tailored to the challenges of hydrologically complex environments like estuaries.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nRasmussen, Nick; Conrad, Louise; Green, Heather; Khanna, Shruti; Wright, Hailey; Caudill, Jeffrey; Gilbert, Patricia; Hoffmann, Krista; Lesmeister, Sarah. 2023-08-14.

To assess differences between lakes and reservoirs that may influence their response to climate change, we compared catchment and waterbody attributes of 132 geographically paired lakes and reservoirs from the 2007 United States Environmental Protection Agencys National Lakes Assessment (NLA) dataset. The data include the NLA IDs of each waterbody and their elevation, catchment area, surface area, perimeter, maximum depth, residence time, Secchi disk depth, surface temperature, and bottom temperature.

            "description": "Since 2007, field data have been collected in the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta in northern California for the purpose of training and validating invasive species maps derived from remote sensing imagery over the Delta. The field crew collected submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) species location data. For each point they noted attributes such as species name(s), location, cover estimates, and patch size. In addition, a thatching rake tethered to a rope was thrown off the side of the boat and pulled back out of the water; Secchi depth was measured using a Secchi disk and depth to the SAV mat was estimated by the field crew. Points were collected in patches larger than 9 square meters (3 m x 3 m). Point locations were measured using high precision (sub-meter accuracy) Trimble DGPS units (Trimble Navigation Limited, Sunnyvale, California) with Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) differential correction. All data points were exported as ArcGIS shapefiles and projected to UTM Zone 10N, Datum WGS-84 however this dataset includes the Latitude and Longitude of each point in decimal degrees. The spatial and attribute data quality was checked by examining photos of the data points and confirming the identify of the documented species.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nKhanna, Shruti; Ustin, Susan; Lay, Mui; Andrew, Margaret; Santos, Maria; Hestir, Erin; Shapiro, Kristen; Bellvert, Joaquim; Greenberg, Jonathan. 2023-04-26.

            "description": " Nutrient enrichment can simultaneously increase and destabilize plant biomass production, with co-limitation by multiple nutrients potentially intensifying these effects. Here, we test how factorial additions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium with essential nutrients (K+) affect the stability (mean/standard deviation) of aboveground biomass in 34 grasslands over seven years. Destabilization with fertilization was prevalent but was driven by single nutrients, not synergistic nutrient interactions. On average, N-based treatments increased mean biomass production by 21-51% but increased its standard deviation by 40-68% and so consistently reduced stability. Adding P increased interannual variability and reduced stability without altering mean biomass, while K+ had no general effects. Declines in stability were largest in the most nutrient-limited grasslands, or where nutrients reduced species richness or intensified species synchrony. We show that nutrients can differentially impact the stability of biomass production, with N and P in particular disproportionately increasing its interannual variability.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nCarroll, Oliver; Batzer, Evan; Bharath, Siddharth; Borer, Elizabeth; Campana, Sof\u00eda; Esch, Ellen; Hautier, Yann; Ohlert, Timothy; Seabloom, Eric; Adler, Peter; Bakker, Jonathan; Biederman, Lori; Bugalho, Miguel; Caldeira, Maria; Chen, Qingqing; Davies, Kendi; Fay, Philip; Knops, Johannes; Komatsu, Kimberly; Martina, Jason; McCann, Kevin; Moore, Joslin; Morgan, John; Muraina, Taofeek; Osborne, Brooke; Risch, Anita; Stevens, Carly; Wilfahrt, Peter; Yahdjian, Laura; MacDougall, Andrew. 2021-12-10.

            "description": " Forbs (\u201cwildflowers\u201d) are important contributors to grassland biodiversity and services, but they are vulnerable to environmental changes that affect their coexistence with grasses. In a factorial experiment at 94 sites on 6 continents, we tested the global generality of several broad predictions arising from previous studies: (1) Forb cover and richness decline under nutrient enrichment, particularly nitrogen enrichment, which benefits grasses at the expense of forbs. (2) Forb cover and richness increase under herbivory by large mammals, especially when nutrients are enriched as grazing will release forbs from decreased grass competition under fertilization. (3) Forb richness and cover are less affected by nutrient enrichment and herbivory in more arid climates, because water limitation reduces the impacts of competition with grasses. We found strong evidence for the first, partial support for the second, and no support for the third prediction. Forb richness and cover are reduced by nutrient addition, with nitrogen having the greatest effect; forb cover is enhanced by large mammal herbivory, although only under conditions of nutrient enrichment and high herbivore intensity; and forb richness is lower in more arid sites, but is not affected by consistent climate-nutrient or climate-herbivory interactions. We also found that nitrogen enrichment disproportionately affects forbs in certain families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae). Our results underscore that anthropogenic nitrogen addition is a major threat to grassland forbs and the ecosystem services they support, but grazing under high herbivore intensity can offset these nutrient effects.

            "description": "Water column bottle samples at multiple depths are taken during CCE Process cruises (since 2006, ongoing) at various CTD stations, and measurements of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) are performed onshore in the lab. TOC includes both dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively). TN includes particulate and dissolved organic nitrogen as well as dissolved inorganic nitrogen species. In open ocean waters, POC is subtracted from TOC, and likely provides an accurate estimate of DOC because particles are typically small and homogeneously distributed in the sample. In coastal waters, and at stations where relatively high chlorophyll concentrations are present, the TOC measurement is not easily converted to DOC by subtracting POC values. Experience has shown that particles in these regions are large and inhomogeneously distributed. Therefore, samples collected in the CCE are reported as TOC and TN, expressed as micromoles of carbon (nitrogen) per liter of sea water.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAluwihare, Lihini. 2024-04-03.

These plots are a subset of\n  500+ forest monitoring plots established in 2004 and 2005 for the\n  purpose of testing strategically-placed land area treatments (SPLATS)\n  that impede forest fire progression (Vaillant 2008, UC Berkeley\n  Doctoral Dissertation). HOBO loggers sampled dates between fall 2016\n  and spring 2019. Some sites have intermittent data due to deactivation\n  for logging activities and some interference from being buried in snow\n  or from wild animals. Please see comments in the plot information file\n  (Logger_Plot_Data.csv) detailing all plot metadata. This monitoring is\n  ongoing through the Sagehen Forest Monitoring Project.

This dataset includes samples collected throughout the Napa River Watershed, California, U.S.A., where high S applications to vineyard agriculture are common. Sample collection focused on tracing the agricultural S \u201cfingerprint\u201d \u2014or the combined S stable isotope composition and concentration of sulfate\u2014through the Watershed. We collected samples during California wet seasons (December \u2013 April) over three years (2017-2020). Samples included vineyard agriculture and non-agricultural (primarily forest, grassland, and shrubland) soil water, culvert outflows, tributaries to the Napa River, and Napa River surface water. The data table includes water sample sulfate concentrations and sulfate-S stable isotope measurements as well as the stable isotope composition of S fungicide samples.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHermes, Anna; Hinckley, Eve-Lyn. 2021-03-08.

            "description": " Rapid changes in climate and land use are having substantial and interacting impacts on lake water quality around the world. Here, we synthesized time-series data for dissolved oxygen, temperature, chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon at multiple depths in 822 lakes to facilitate analyses of these changes. The dataset extends from 1921\u20132022, with a median data duration of 29 years (range 5-102) and a median of 5 unique sampling dates per year at each lake. Lakes in the dataset have a median depth of 12.5 m (range 1.5\u2013480 m), median surface area of 85.4 ha (range: 0.5\u2013237000 ha) and median elevation of 264 m (range: -215\u20132804). The lakes are located in 18 countries across 5 continents, with latitudes ranging from -42.6 to 68.3. To facilitate interoperability with other large-scale datasets, each lake is linked to a unique hydroLAKES lake ID when possible (n = 683).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLewis, Abigail; Lau, Maximilian; Jane, Stephen; Beeri-Shlevin, Yaron; Burnet, Sarah; Clayer, Francois; Feuchtmayr, Heidrun; Grossart, Hans-Peter; Howard, Dexter; Mariash, Heather; Delgado-Martin, Jordi; North, Rebecca; Oleksy, Isabella; Pilla, Rachel; Rose, Kevin; Smagula, Amy; Sommaruga, Ruben; Steiner, Sara; Verburg, Piet; Wain, Danielle; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa; Carey, Cayelan. 2023-11-09.

            "description": "Water column bottle samples at multiple depths are taken during CalCOFI cruises (since 2006, ongoing) at various CTD stations, and measurements of total organic carbon (TOC) are performed onshore in the lab. TOC includes both dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively). In open ocean waters, POC is subtracted from TOC, and likely provides an accurate estimate of DOC because particles are typically small and homogeneously distributed in the sample. In coastal waters, and at stations where relatively high chlorophyll concentrations are present, the TOC measurement is not easily converted to DOC by subtracting POC values. Experience has shown that particles in these regions are large and inhomogeneously distributed. Therefore, samples collected in the CCE are reported as TOC, expressed as micromoles of carbon per liter of sea water.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAluwihare, Lihini. 2025-06-13.

Seawater is collected in up to 24 Niskin bottles at specific depths (up to 1000m), determined by the chlorophyll maximum and mixed layer depth as the instrument is lowered through the water column. The samples are filtered and analyzed at sea and used to assess the CTD sensor data quality.  Measurements include depth, temperature, salinity, density (sigma theta), oxygen, O2 saturation, PAR (radiation, surface radiation and irradiance), fluorescence and transmission.  Salinity checks are performed with a salinometer back at the lab.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoericke, Ralf. 2022-12-12.

            "description": " Extratropical cyclones are responsible for major weather events and trends in the\n        mid-latitudes and preferentially develop in regions of enhanced cyclogenesis and proceed\n        along climatological storm tracks. It has been shown that terrestrial snow cover exerts\n        considerable influence on atmospheric baroclinicity which is largely responsible for the\n        aforementioned cyclogeneses and storm tracks. Research about the effect which terrestrial\n        snow cover exerts on cyclones' intensities, trajectories, and precipitation characteristics\n        is limited but indicates a robust relationship with these factors. Many examinations of\n        climate model projections have generally shown a poleward shift in storm tracks by the late\n        21st century though none have determined the degree to which the coincident poleward shift\n        in snow extent is responsible. A method of imposing 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile values of snow retreat between the\n        late 20th and 21st centuries as projected by 14 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison\n        Project Phase Five (CMIP5) is used to alter 20 historical cold season cyclones which tracked\n        over or adjacent to the North American Great Plains. Simulations by the Advanced Research\n        version of the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF-ARW) are initialized at 0 to 4 days\n        prior to cyclogenesis. Including control and sensitivity testing wherein snow is unaltered\n        or removed entirely, each cyclone case is simulated 25 times for a total of 500\n        simulations.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nClare, Ryan; Desai, Ankur; Notaro, Michael; Martin, Jonathan; Vavrus, Stephen;  Mesinger, Fedor; Taylor, Karl. 2022-12-22.

            "description": " The Adult Striped Bass Study was operated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (previous Department of Fish and Game) between 1969 and 2022. The objective of this study was to generate estimates of adult striped bass harvest and abundance for use in managing the striped bass recreational fishery and tracking impacts of water management on the striped bass population. Striped bass and other species were captured using 20' length by 10' diameter fyke traps and 600' length by 21' depth surface-drift style gillnets with stretched mesh measurements of 4\", 4.5\", 5\", and 5.5\". The survey typically operated between April and June, with fyke traps deployed in the Sacramento River and gillnets deployed in the lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. A portion of adult or legal-sized striped bass were tagged with external 1/2\" Petersen-disk tags for use in mark-recapture analyses. All external tags were individually coded, and a subset were assigned a reward value of 2 to 100 US dollars. Due to the targeted nature of this study, non-striped bass species and untagged striped bass were not recorded prior to 1996. In addition, effort data (aside from sampling day/event) are not available prior to 1994. Due to these and other limitations, the publishing authors recommend caution be exercised when attempting to quantify relative trends in abundance (i.e. CPUE) from these data.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStompe, Dylan; Hobbs, James. 2024-01-02.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program San Francisco Estuary 20-mm Survey was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in 1995 to monitor the distribution and abundance of post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Delta Smelt are considered to be an annual fish endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary that spawn in early spring and rear through the summer and fall in fresh to brackish water. Young of the Year (YOY) Delta Smelt are considered juveniles at sizes greater than or equal to 20-mm, and this survey targets those Delta Smelt. The 20-mm Survey currently samples 61 stations at fixed locations from San Pablo Bay through Suisun Bay and into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta every other week from March to July.  The survey has historically sampled between 41 and 55 stations. At each station, three 10-minute stepped oblique tows are conducted for fish. Each stepped oblique tow follows a tow schedule to sample the water column up to 32 ft, and the volume of water sampled is estimated using a General Oceanics flowmeter. The net is a cone shaped plankton net composed of 1600\u03bcm mesh and measuring 5.5 meters in length with a mouth area of 1.51m2 lashed onto a rigid D-frame with skis. Post-larval and juvenile fish samples are preserved in the field in 10% Formalin dyed with Rose Bengal and brought back to the CDFW Stockton Lab for identification to species and enumeration under a microscope. Fish are measured to fork length or total length when fork is not present. At each station, environmental and water quality data are also collected, and include: top temperature, top and bottom electrical conductivity (normalized at 25 degree C), secchi (cm), surface water clarity (FNU), and tidal condition.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBrennan, Colin; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica. 2024-10-30.

This effort was born out of the Delta Smelt\n  Resiliency Strategy Aquatic Weed Control Action study, which, in order\n  to calculate fish biomass, needed to calculate individual fish weights\n  from their measured lengths. The Aquatic Weed Control study was\n  supported by Interagency Ecological Program through the Endangered\n  Species Act and is included in the Interagency Ecological Program\n  2017-2019 workplan. Weight is estimated from length using the\n  exponential function W=a  L^b. These can be calculated using\n  the linear regression of the log-transformed equation\n  (log\u2061(W)=log\u2061(a)+b log(L)). This dataset provides the\n  species-specific a and b parameters. Associated publication(s) and\n  relevant metadata information are included. Data was obtained either\n  via database (fishbase.us) or peer-reviewed scientific papers.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPerry, Sarah. 2020-04-29.

            "description": " Overview The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) funds habitat improvement work and associated monitoring in the Central Valley of California to increase salmonid populations in furtherance of meeting CVPIA fish doubling goals.  This data package contains three datasets for larval White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) monitoring in the San Joaquin River (SJR) conducted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Lodi Fish and Wildlife Office. SJR_Larval_WST_Set Data This dataset contains data on an experimental sampling program using boat-mounted drift nets (D-frame nets), a large drift net attached to a stationary pontoon (pontoon net), and otter trawls to catch larval White Sturgeon in the San Joaquin River. Sets were made at targeted locations from March-July in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. A total of ten White Sturgeon were captured in 2016 and 11 in 2017, all with D-frame driftnets. SJR_Larval_WST_Catch Data This dataset contains data for individual fish caught in the San Joaquin River. Species and fork length were recorded for most individuals. SJR_Fish_Taxonomy Data This dataset contains data for fish codes used in the Catch datafile. For each species that was captured, the Species codes are listed with the corresponding Interagency Ecological Program code, common name, taxonomy (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species), and whether or not the species is native to the region.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service; Steinhart, Geoff. 2024-01-24.

            "description": "Active and passive fluorescence measurements are made using the ALFA5 system (Chekalyuk and Hafez, 2013) on water from the ship\u2019s underway system (these are not samples from bottles!) during CalCOFI cruises while on station. The instrument uses excitation at 405 and 510 nm to measures passively the fluorescence of chlorophyll-a (Chl), three different phycoerythrins (PE1, PE2 and PE3) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm) is measured actively using pump-during-probe (PDP) measurements of Chl a fluorescence induction. Fluorescence measurements are normalized to the water\u2019s Raman fluorescence. ALF data are merged with CTD and bottle data that were collected by the CalCOFI group.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoericke, Ralf. 2022-05-24.

            "description": "Active and passive fluorescence measurements are made using the ALFA5 system (Chekalyuk and Hafez, 2013) on water from the ship\u2019s underway system during CCE process cruises. The instrument uses excitation at 405 and 510 nm to measures passively the fluorescence of chlorophyll-a (Chl), three different phycoerythrins (PE1, PE2 and PE3) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm) is measured actively using pump-during-probe (PDP) measurements of Chl a fluorescence induction.  Fluorescence measurements are normalized to the water\u2019s Raman fluorescence.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoericke, Ralf; Chekalyuk, Alexander. 2022-12-13.

            "description": "The collection and enumeration of sinking fecal pellets on CCE LTER Process cruises has been led by Mike Stukel since 2007. Sinking particles are collected in VERTEX-style particle interceptor traps (PIT) with an 8:1 aspect ratio, 70-mm diameter, and a baffle on top comprised of 13 smaller beveled tubes with a similar 8:1 aspect ratio. Tubes are deployed with a formalin-brine for a duration of 2-5 days. After recovery, samples are gently split on a Folsom splitter and typically 3/8 to 1/2 of two separate tubes are utilized for fecal pellet enumeration. After the cruise, samples for fecal pellet enumeration are placed in a settling chamber to allow fecal pellets to settle out. Overlying water is then strained through a 60-um filter to collect any pellets that may have remained in the water. Pellets were then placed on a gridded Petri dish and analyzed using a Zeiss Discovery stereomicroscope. Pellets were separated from other particles and photographed with a dedicated camera. Image processing was then conducted using either Image J or Image Pro to extract area and maximum feret length for each fecal pellet. Pellets were classified by shape and shape-appropriate equations were used to determine the volume of each fecal pellet. Volume was converted to mass using the equations in Stukel et al. (2013). \u2018Sample\u2019 refers to which of two samples the fecal pellet was contained within. \u2018PelletID\u2019 is the identifier for each fecal pellet in a sample. \u2018Conversion Factor\u2019 accounts for the proportion of a sample that was sorted for fecal pellets, as well as the deployment duration and cross-sectional area of the sediment trap. To determine the mass flux of fecal pellets of a certain type: 1) Sum the pellet mass for all fecal pellets of that type in a given sample and 2) multiply by the Conversion factor for that sample. \u2018Shape\u2019 is an identifier for the shape of a fecal pellet: 1) ovoid, 2) cylindrical, 3) spherical, 4) tabular, 5) amorphous, 6) ellipsoidal, 7) degraded fecal material.

A major component of this program is regional HAB monitoring with support from the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System (SCCOOS) and the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). Water samples and net tows are collected once per week at piers to monitor for HAB species, the neurotoxin domoic acid, and water quality data including temperature, chlorophyll-a, and nutrients. The sampling stations represented in this dataset include Santa Cruz Wharf, Monterey Wharf, Cal Poly Pier, Stearns Wharf, Santa Monica Pier, Newport Beach Pier, and Scripps Pier. These data are consolidated and reformatted into Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) format from the level 1 site-specific datasets hosted on the SCCOOS ERDDAP server: (https://erddap.sccoos.org/erddap/tabledap/index.html?page=1).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAnderson, Clarissa; Brzesinski, Mark; Caron, Dave; Carter, Melissa; Jones, Janice; Kudela, Raphael; Largier, John; Negrey, Kendra; Pasulka, Alexis; Ruhl, Henry; Shipe, Rebecca; Smith, G.

Tubes are filled with dense seawater to create a density gradient, and are attached to a wire connected to a drifting float for up to 4 days.  Samples from the recovered array of the trap material (fecal matter and other sinking particles - zooplankton removed) are filtered onto precombusted filters for analyses of particulate carbon and nitrogen flux rates for each cycle in the CCE Process cruises (since 2007, ongoing)\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nStukel, Mike; Landry, Michael. 2022-12-12.

            "description": "Water column bottle samples at multiple depths are taken during CCE Process cruises (since 2006, ongoing) at various CTD stations, filtered, and stored at -20\u00b0C. Measurements of particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) are performed onshore in the lab where samples are acidified, dried and analyzed by high-temperature combustion. The sample and tin capsule react with oxygen and combust at 1000\u00b0C, and the sample is broken down, thus converting organic carbon to CO2 and reducing nitrogen oxides to N2 gas. Both gases are measured by thermal conductivity. Samples analyzed within the CCE constrain the mean C:N ratio of small particulates and by difference relative to measured living biomass, the biomass of suspended detritus.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nAluwihare, Lihini. 2025-05-14.

            "description": "Water column bottle samples at multiple depths are taken during CalCOFI cruises (since 2004, ongoing) at various CTD stations, filtered, and stored at -20\u00b0C. Measurements of particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) are performed onshore in the lab where samples are acidified, dried and analyzed by high-temperature combustion. The sample and tin capsule react with oxygen and combust at 1000\u00b0C, and the sample is broken down, thus converting organic carbon to CO2 and reducing nitrogen oxides to N2 gas. Both gases are measured by thermal conductivity. Samples analyzed within the CCE constrain the mean C:N ratio of small particulates and by difference relative to measured living biomass, the biomass of suspended detritus.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoericke, Ralf. 2025-06-13.

            "description": " We collected this data to better understand the timing of peak benthic cyanobacterial mat occurrence (specifically taxa associated with anatoxin production, Microcoleus and Anabaena) and mat anatoxin concentrations in rivers. We sampled in northern California on the South Fork Eel, Salmon, and Russian Rivers biweekly in 2022, and the Salmon River biweekly and South Fork Eel weekly in 2023. During each sampling event, we conducted benthic cover surveys, measured in-situ water quality parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity), and collected surface water samples and targeted cyanobacteria samples. In 2022 on all rivers and in 2023 at the Salmon River, we also collected distributed non-targeted periphyton samples to characterize full-reach community compositions. All sampling was completed in 150-m reaches upstream of sensors recording continuous dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature data. We analyzed surface water samples for nitrate, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphate, total dissolved carbon, and dissolved organic carbon. We also analyzed surface water samples from 2022 for major anions (Cl, SO4, Br) and cations (Na, K, Mg, Ca). Targeted-cyanobacteria and non-target periphyton samples were analyzed for anatoxins, relative abundance of algal taxa (via microscopy), ash-free dry mass, and chlorophyll-a. To estimate mean river depth within the dissolved oxygen footprint upstream of sensors, we kayaked portions of the river and collected river depth measurements. We also measured discharge at each river excluding the Salmon River (due to high discharge) and completed pebble counts at the South Fork Eel River to obtain sediment grain size distributions.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nZabrecky, Jordan; Elliott, Taryn; Hickey, Meaghan; Lei, Helen; Christova, Rosalina; Boyer, Gregory; Genzoli, Laurel; Johnson, Grant; Blaszczak, Joanna. 2025-04-28.

            "description": " Agricultural sulfur (S) inputs are a major source of anthropogenic S to the environment, often stimulating microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) in downstream environments, which can drive a cascade of unintended ecosystem consequences. This dataset includes samples collected throughout the Napa River Watershed, California, USA, where routine, high S applications to vineyards are common. Sampling was focused confirming the presence of microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) within upland soils, challenging the conventional view that this process is restricted to fully saturated environments. We collected soil samples for sulfate concentrations, sulfate reduction rates (SRRs), and organic C content (Loss On Ignition, LOI) under three different hydrological conditions: while soils were moist (November 2021), dry (January/February 2022), and saturated (January/February 2023). We collected samples from a variety of different land cover types, including vineyard, vineyard stream, grassland, forest, forest stream, and wetland.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHinckley, Eve-Lyn; Rea, Laura. 2025-03-05.

            "description": " This data package describes long-term trends in metrics describing population stability and used as statistical early warnings of regime shifts in 29 fish species that inhabit the San Francisco Bay-Delta in central California, USA. Metrics used in this study include spatial synchrony, temporal coefficient of variation (CV), and lag-1 temporal autocorrelation. Trends were measured using ordinary least squares linear regression. These derived data were developed from abundance (as CPUE) time series based on three long-term fish monitoring studies included in https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a29a6e674b0f8797e13fbc4b08b92e5b; the Fall Midwater Trawl Survey, Delta Juvenile Monitoring Program, and Bay Study. Selected data were from fall months (September to December) in 1980-2023, from midwater trawl and beach seine surveys for which sampling effort (e.g., tow volume) was recorded. Data on fish exceeding maximum length thresholds for age-0 fish were discarded, except for white sturgeon, where the maximum length threshold corresponded to approximately 10 years of age, the onset of reproductive maturity. Observations from different sampling stations were aggregated into 10 sub-regions (South San Francisco Bay, Central San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, Napa River, Suisun Bay, Delta Confluence, South Delta, North Delta, San Joaquin River, Sacramento River, and midwater trawl samples and beach seine samples were considered separately because the methods sample distinct habitat types. Combinations of sub-region and sampling method were considered distinct spatial units. EWI metrics were measured in 5-year rolling windows to permit assessment of changes over time. The temporal CV and lag-1 autocorrelation were measured on individual spatial unit time series, ignoring windows with >1 year of missing data. The coefficient of variation divides the standard deviation by the mean. Lag-1 autocorrelation was measured as Pearson correlation. Spatial synchrony was measured across spatial units, ignoring spatial units with >1 year of missing data, and ignoring rolling windows where <3 spatial units had sufficient data. Spatial synchrony was measured as the mean of pairwise Spearman correlations. Trends in EWI metrics were measured only when there were at least 5 rolling window measurements spanning at least 10 years.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nWalter, Jonathan; Bashevkin, Samuel; Nguyen, Trinh; Tham, Enoch; Gaeta, Jereme; Mitchell, Lara; Khanna, Shruti. 2025-02-17.

Data was downloaded from the websites of the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Census Bureau, and Southern California Association of Governments. Due to redlining and disinvestment in neighborhoods of color, there are generally fewer green spaces and greater urban heat island effects in neighborhoods of color throughout the U.S., as documented in the environmental justice literature. Replacing impervious surfaces like concrete and asphalt with green stormwater infrastructure can help increase green space and reduce urban heat while also meeting local stormwater goals. This research supports existing findings and ties it to the local stormwater context in Los Angeles County. Based on the results of this research, local decision-makers should consider racial demographics when prioritizing where to remove impervious surface and replacing with green stormwater infrastructure.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nKung, Megan. 2024-06-20.

            "description": " The overarching goal of this project was to develop a process-based understanding of how watershed-to-lake connections drive nearshore productivity dynamics in a large oligotrophic mountain lake (Lake Tahoe). We addressed this goal through a combined approach of high-frequency sensor deployment and maintenance, ecosystem metabolism modeling, laboratory incubations, and routine monitoring of water chemistry and other parameters. The data we collected as part of this project and the ecosystem metabolism estimates we generated demonstrate how variable ecosystem productivity is in time and space in the nearshore of Lake Tahoe. Although maintenance of the sensor arrays during the exceptional winter of 2023 was challenging, we were able to capture the data necessary to estimate a complete time series of metabolic activity across two years with very different hydroclimatic conditions. Throughout this project we accomplished the following: 1. We generated over two years of daily estimates of ecosystem metabolism (gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem productivity) from multiple locations on both the east and west shores of the lake and from areas in close proximity to and far away from stream water inflows. 2. We measured ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in surface water samples from both Glenbrook and Blackwood creeks and the nearshore of Lake Tahoe for over two years. 3. We quantified rates of NH4+ and NO3- uptake in benthic samples of the dominant substrate type collected during peak streamflow, the receding limb, and baseflow conditions in 2023 from multiple locations in the nearshore using established laboratory incubation methods. 4. Finally, we used a combination of time series models and structural equation modeling to integrate our results and improve understanding of the direct and indirect effects of hydroclimatic variability on observed patterns in ecosystem metabolism in the nearshore.

            "description": " The Interagency Ecological Program\u2019s (IEP) Summer Townet Survey (STN) is a long-term effort to monitor the annual recruitment success of young pelagic fishes in the upper San Francisco Estuary (California, United States). Conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) since 1959, STN has sampled fixed locations from Eastern San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista on the Sacramento River, and to Stockton on the San Joaquin River; and a single station in the lower Napa River. The study area was expanded in 2011 to include the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (SDWSC) and Cache Slough (CS). Currently, 40 stations are sampled as a \u201csurvey\u201d every other week June through August for 6 surveys. A conical net, lashed to a fixed metal \u201cD\u201d frame, is pulled obliquely through the water column 2 to 3 times at each station. All fish and macro-invertebrates are identified and enumerated from each tow, with fork lengths (mm) of the first 50 of each fish species also recorded. Fish catch, length-frequency, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) among stations is available with data visualization tools on the study website for all species (https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey).  Data collected at historic 31 stations are used to calculate annual relative abundance indices for age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The remaining 9 stations are sampled to expand our sampling range further upriver and increase our understanding of larval and juvenile fish abundance and distribution in the lower Napa River and the North Delta. A meso-zooplankton net targeting copepods and cladocerans is also used in parallel to assess fish food resources at each station and a subset of the fish collected are retained for diet analysis by CDFW researchers (beginning 2005, see STN and FMWT zooplankton data on EDI). The STN also measures habitat conditions via water temperature (\u00b0C), water clarity (Secchi disk depth in cm), Turbidity (NTU) and specific conductance (\u00b5s/cm). Historically, STN began in response to the development of Central Valley Project pumping plants exporting water from the South Delta. STN continues to monitor fish abundance and distribution in relation to water diversions, for the operation of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, and management flow actions to improve summer-fall habitat conditions. Managers and researchers use the data collected by STN to inform decisions and improve our understanding of the health of the upper San Francisco Estuary.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nMalinich, Timothy; White, James; Slater, Steven; Breining-Aday, Spencer; Ugbah, Nene. 2023-12-04.

            "description": "The abundances of 385 taxonomic categories of phytoplankton (species where possible) are presented for the 26.5 -year period beginning with summer, 1996 and concluding with autumn 2022. There were four cruises per year. Samples were water samples collected from the second depth, which was designed to sample the mixed layer when a mixed layer existed, generally between 5m - 15m. Before counting, samples from single stations were pooled into four regions: NE (northern inshore), SE (southern inshore), Alley (the region of the California Current) and Offshore (Central Pacific). Pooled samples were enumerated with an inverted microscope. The species data are presented by seven major taxonomic categories followed by the sums of those major taxa. The species codes are defined in the table metadata.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nVenrick, Elizabeth. 2023-06-05.

Enhancements include installation of gravel to restore over 28 acres of spawning habitat and in-channel/floodplain grading to create over 44 acres of rearing habitat. Construction of Lower Sailor Bar and Nimbus Basin were completed in summer 2022, Upper River Bend was completed in summer 2023, and Lower River Bend was completed in summer 2024. The goal of the projects is to increase existing spawning and rearing habitat for salmonids under typical flows. This work supports effectiveness monitoring for this project, including spawning and rearing (snorkel) surveys before and after restoration. This work also informs performance metrics and adaptive management strategies.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSweeney, Jamie. 2025-01-22.

The size distribution of total chlorophyll a is determined by filtering water though filters of differing pore sizes. These are then extracted in acetone and analyzed fluorometrically with Turner Designs 10-AU Fluorometer on CCE Process cruises (since 2006, ongoing). Chlorophyll a and taxon-specific pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) are qualitatively and quantitatively characterized in the lab onshore by several size fractions (< 1\u00b5m to > 20\u00b5m) utilizing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The samples analyzed within the CCE region are used to develop a metric for phytoplankton community structure that can be used to monitor its state and changes thereof over time.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGoericke, Ralf. 2025-06-25.

            "description": " Coastal upwelling ecosystems associated with strong physical stirring exhibit fine-scale hydrographic and biological patchiness. Though many studies have found broad correlations between hydrographic properties (e.g., temperature and salinity) and phytoplankton biomass, we lack a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms and how to diagnose patchy distributions. Here, using observational data from coastal waters in the California Current System, we demonstrate that the maximum observed chlorophyll in a water parcel increases with salinity\u2014a conservative water-mass tracer. This relationship arises from sub-euphotic zone nitrate concentrations, which also increase with salinity. Therefore, we can define maximum potential chlorophyll as a function of salinity and nitrate. We show that variations in salinity explain patterns in phytoplankton community structure and discuss how growth, grazing, and light and micronutrient limitation can generate chlorophyll values below the maximum potential. Our mechanistic explanation provides a novel framework for diagnosing biological patchiness using salinity observations.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGangrade, Shailja. 2024-09-11.

            "description": " The fish larvae (ichthyoplankton) survey is conducted through the\n    California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations program (CALCOFI,\n    http://www.calcofi.org/). These data are a time series of fish\n    larvae counts (or density, as number per 10 square meter of ocean\n    surface) collected in the area of the California Current between San\n    Diego and Avila Beach, California. Original data were filtered to\n    facilitate consistent comparisons over time and space. The original CalCOFI fish larvae count data is available from the\n    CoastWatch West Coast Regional Node (WCRN) at NOAA\u2019s Pacific\n    Fisheries Environmental Laboratory,\n    http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/index.html. The\n    dataset presented here is an aggregation of 31 data files,\n    originally divided alphabetically by taxon (named \u201cCalCOFI Larvae\n    Counts, Scientific Names * to *\u201d). The data were filtered to include\n    only the 66 core stations with a maximum of 1 cruise per season.\n    These 66 core stations have been most frequently sampled in the past\n    and sampling is ongoing. CalCOFI sampling began in 1949. However, the dataset presented here\n    begins in 1966 to include only samples that were analyzed with\n    techniques that apply the most current and accurate identification\n    of larvae to the species level. As the backlog of samples (i.e.,\n    before 1966) is re-examined, this dataset will be augmented with\n    that additional, earlier data.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nThompson, Andrew; Miller, Robert J; Kui, Li. 2022-12-08.

            "description": " We conduct a Lagrangian particle trajectory analysis of surface velocities. We\n                define an \u201coffshore water age\u201d as the time taken by a water parcel to be advected\n                backward in time from its current position along its trajectory until it crosses the\n                500 m isobath. The rationale of this diagnostic is to detect filaments of coastal\n                water advected offshore by horizontal transport and to estimate the time for water\n                parcels in the filament o leave the coastal area. For example, a value of \u201c20 days\u201d\n                assigned to a pixel means that the water parcel in that area was in the coastal area\n                approximately 20 days before, where it was likely enriched in nutrients.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nChabert, Pierre; d'Ovidio, Francesco; Echevin, Vincent; Stukel, Michael; Ohman, Mark. 2021-08-13.

            "description": " Identifying the scaling rules describing ecological patterns across time and space is a central challenge in ecology. Taylor\u2019s Law of fluctuation scaling, which states that the variance of a population is proportional to a positive power of the mean, has been widely observed in population dynamics and characterizes variability in multiple scientific domains. However, it is unclear if this phenomenon accurately describes ecological patterns across many orders of magnitude in time, and therefore links otherwise disparate observations. This dataset uses light attenuation observations from 10,531 days of high-frequency measurements in 35 globally distributed lakes to test this unknown. We focus on water clarity as an integrative ecological characteristic that responds to both biotic and abiotic drivers. We provide documentation that variations in ecological measurements across diverse sites and temporal scales exhibit variance patterns consistent with Taylor\u2019s Law, and that model coefficients increase in a predictable yet non-linear manner with decreasing observation frequency.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGlines, Max; Amancio, Renata; Andersen, Mikkel; Baulch, Helen; Brighenti, Ludmila; Chmiel, Hannah; de Eyto, Elvira; Erina, Oxana; Feuchtmayr, Heidrun; Flaim, Giovanna; Giudici, Andrea; Hamilton, David; Huot, Yannick; Kelly, Michael; Kelly, Se\u00e1n; Laas, Alo; McBride, Christopher; Minaudo, Camille; Neto, Jose; Nugent, Katy; Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, C\u00e9sar; Perga, Marie-Elodie; Reid, Brian; Scott, Caren; Staehr, Peter; Tonetta, Denise; Wain, Danielle; Ward, Nicole; Rose, Kevin. 2024-01-16.

            "description": " We identified variables controlling stream nitrogen concentrations and\n  fluxes, and how they have changed over time, by synthesizing 20 time\n  series ranging from 5 to 51 years of data collected from forest and\n  grassland dominated watersheds across Europe, North America, and East\n  Asia and across four climate types (tropical, temperate,\n  Mediterranean, and boreal) using the International Long-Term\n  Ecological Research Network. We found declining trends in bulk\n  ammonium and nitrate deposition, with ammonium contributing\n  significantly more to atmospheric nitrogen deposition over time. Among\n  sites, there were significant positive relationships between (1)\n  precipitation and stream ammonium and nitrate fluxes and (2)\n  atmospheric nitrogen inputs and stream nitrogen concentrations and\n  fluxes. There were no significant relationships between air\n  temperature and stream nitrogen export. Our long-term data shows that\n  although nitrogen deposition is declining over time, atmospheric\n  nitrogen inputs and precipitation remain the main predictors for\n  nitrogen exported from forested and grassland watersheds. Overall, we\n  also demonstrate that long-term monitoring provides understanding of\n  ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling that would not be possible with\n  short-term studies alone.

            "description": " This dataset provides information on the endurance swimming performance and physiological responses of juvenile Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), reared and tested at the University of California, Davis, in 2022. Fish were acclimated to two temperature treatments (13\u00b0C and 18\u00b0C) for 14 days prior to swimming trials. Endurance tests were conducted at 47\u201353 days post-hatch (DPH) in modified swim tunnels at fixed water velocities (25\u201355 cm s\u207b\u00b9) to measure time-to-fatigue (End.min), station-holding behavior (Station_holding), and swimming type (Swim.type). Fish morphometrics (e.g., weight, fork length, total length) were recorded before trials. Post-swim physiological analyses included whole-body measurements of cortisol, glucose, lactate, and protein. Tissue homogenates were processed to determine concentrations normalized to fish weight (e.g., Cortisol_ng_g, Glucose_ug_g, Lactate_ug_g). Standard curves showed high assay linearity (R\u00b2 > 0.98) and low variability (CV < 10%). This dataset contributes to understanding sturgeon endurance and physiological stress under different environmental conditions, providing insights into their resilience to temperature and flow changes relevant to river management and conservation efforts. Variables include: species, developmental stage (DPH), rearing and trial conditions (tank, temperature, velocity), fish morphometrics (weight, fork length, total length), and physiological metrics (cortisol, protein, glucose, and lactate).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHannan, Kelly. 2025-01-09.

            "description": "  Overview Operation of rotary screw traps on the Lower American River is part of a collaborative effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The primary objectives of the study are to collect data that can be used to estimate the passage of juvenile fall-run Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and to quantify the raw catch of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss as well as winter, spring, and late fall runs of Chinook Salmon. Secondary objectives of the trapping operations focus on collecting biological data on juvenile salmonids and gathering environmental data that will be used to develop models that correlate environmental parameters with salmonid size, temporal presence, abundance, and production. The data package contains seven datasets including: raw catch, trap operation, environmental, and trap efficiency data.  Raw Catch \u2013 Chinook Dataset This dataset covers ALL Chinook Salmon captured by the rotary screw traps. This spreadsheet includes biological data on: 1) unmarked fall-, spring-, and winter-run Chinook Salmon 2) marked (adipose clipped OR \"fin clip\") hatchery origin Chinook Salmon 3) recaptured marked fall-run (BBY OR \"Pigment / Dye\", Photonic Dye, and VIE OR \"Elastomer\") Chinook Salmon utilized in trap efficiency trials.  Raw Catch \u2013 Steelhead Dataset This dataset covers ALL steelhead captured by the rotary screw traps. This spreadsheet includes biological data on: 1) unmarked (natural origin) steelhead 2) marked (adipose clipped OR \"fin clip\") hatchery origin steelhead 3) recaptured marked steelhead utilized in trap efficiency trials.  Raw Catch \u2013 ByCatch Dataset This dataset provides biological data on ALL catch (EXCLUDING Chinook Salmon or steelhead) captured by the rotary screw traps. All catch in this table is of natural origin.  Trap Operations Dataset This dataset provides trap operation data for each trap visit. Specifically, it includes data on the visit type, trap functioning status, start and end sampling dates and times, total revolutions and instantaneous revolution speeds, livewell intake statuses, debris data, and whether the catch associated for this record will be include for juvenile production estimates.  Environmentals Dataset This dataset covers environmental data collected at the rotary screw traps. This spreadsheet includes turbidity (nephelometric turbidity units), water velocity (meters per second), dissolved oxygen (milligrams per liter), and water depth (centimeters).  Trap Efficiency Summary Dataset This dataset provides a summary of each trap efficiency trial conducted. It includes the release date and time, the length of the test, the number of marked fish released and recaptured, and whether the trial was included for juvenile production estimates.  Trap Efficiency Release FL Dataset This dataset provides biological data on a subsample of released fish utilized in trap efficiency trials.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nDay, Logan; Morris, Hunter. 2024-11-19.

            "description": " Global environmental change has influenced lake surface temperatures, a key driver of\n\t\t\t\tecosystem structure and function. Recent studies have suggested significant warming of water\n\t\t\t\ttemperatures in individual lakes across many different regions around the world. However,\n\t\t\t\tthe spatial and temporal coherence associated with the magnitude of these trends remains\n\t\t\t\tunclear. Thus, a global dataset of water temperature is required to understand and\n\t\t\t\tsynthesize global, long-term trends in surface water temperatures of inland bodies of water.\n\t\t\t\tWe assembled a database of summer lake surface temperatures for 291 lakes collected in situ\n\t\t\t\tand/or by satellites for the period 1985-2009. In addition, corresponding climatic drivers\n\t\t\t\t(air temperatures, solar radiation, and cloud cover) and geomorphometric characteristics\n\t\t\t\t(latitude, longitude, elevation, lake surface area, maximum depth, mean depth, and volume)\n\t\t\t\tthat influence lake surface temperatures were compiled for each lake. This unique dataset\n\t\t\t\toffers an invaluable baseline perspective on global-scale lake thermal conditions as\n\t\t\t\tenvironmental change continues. This dataset accompanies a data publication in the journal Scientific Data\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nSharma, Sapna; Gray, Derek; Read, Jordan; Oreilly, Catherine; Schneider, Philipp; Qudrat, Anam; Gries, Corinna; Stefanoff, Samantha; Hampton, Stephanie; Hook, Simon; Lenters, John; Livingstone, David; McIntyre, Peter; Adrian, Rita; Allan, Mathew; Anneville, Orlane; Arvola, Lauri; Austin, Jay; Bailey, John; Baron, Jill; Brookes, Justin; Chen, Yuwei; Daly, Robert; Dokulil, Martin; Dong, Bo; Ewing, Kye; de Eyto, Elvira; Hamilton, David; Havens, Karl; Haydon, Shane; Hetzenauer, Harald; Heneberry, Joceylene; Hetherington, Amy; Higgins, Scott; Hixcon, Eric; Izmest'eva, Lyubov; Jones, Benjamin; Kangur, Kullli; Kasprzak, Peter; Koster, Olivier; Kraemer, Benjamin; Kumagai, Michio; Kuusisto, Esko; Leshkevich, George; May, Linda; MacIntyre, Sally; Mueller-Navarra, Doerthe; Naumenko, Mikhail; Noges, Peeter; Noges, Tiina; Niederhauser, Pius; North, Ryan; Paterson, Andrew; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis; Rigosi, Anna; Rimmer, Alon; Rogora, Michela; Rudstram, Lars; Rusak, James; Salmaso, Nico; Samal, Nihar; Schindler, Daniel; Schladow, Geoffrey; Schmidt, Silke; Schultz, Tracey; Silow, Eugene; Straile, Dietmar; Teubner, Katrin; Verburg, Piet; Voutilainen, Ari; Watkinson, Andrew; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa; Williamson, Craig; Woo, Kara. 2022-11-15.

Constraining short- and long-term variability is necessary to improve detection of temporal changes of CO2 fluxes in response to natural and anthropogenic drivers. These data were collected based on a workshop and open call for eddy covariance observations over lakes organized by Ankur Desai (UW-Madison), Timo Vesala (U Helsinki), and Malgorzata Golub (DKIT).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nGolub, Malgorzata; Desai, Ankur; Vesala, Timo; Mammarella, Ivan; Ojala, Anne; Bohrer, Gil; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa; Blanken, Peter; Eugster, Werner; Franz, Daniela; Koebsch, Franziska; Chen, Jiquan; Czajkowski, Kevin; Deshmukh, Chandra Shekhar; Elbers, Jan; Friborg, Thomas; Glatzel, Stephan; Guerin, Frederic; Heiskanen, Jouni; Humphreys, Elyn; Jammet, Mathilde; Jonsson, Anders; Jussi, Vourenmaa; Karlsson, Jan; Kling, George; Lee, Xuhui; Liu, Heping; Lohila, Annalea; Lundin, Erik; Morin, Tim; Podgrajsek, Eva; Provenzale, Maria; Rutgersson, Anna; Sachs, Torsten; Sahlee, Erik; Serca, Dominique; Shao, Changliang; Shaver, Gus; Spence, Christopher; Strachan, Ian; Xiao, Wei. 2022-04-18.

            "description": " The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Program (SBSPRP) is the largest wetland restoration project in the western United States, restoring approximately 15,000 acres of former salt evaporation ponds (southbaysaltpond.org) to benefit wildlife and fish populations.  Restoration on a large scale comes with many risks and uncertainties.  Therefore, restoration was planned in several phases, with an adaptive management approach and applied scientific studies to address the uncertainty of different restoration strategies.  These strategies included breaching ponds to create fully tidal habitats, installing tide gates to create muted tidal habitats and active management of existing ponds. This mosaic of restoration designs was intended to benefit many species of salt marsh dependent biota, including birds, fish and mammalian species. The Longjaw Mudusucker (Gillichthys mirabilis) is a resident estuarine fish, ranging from Mexico to Humboldt Bay, California, USA, and is one of the most abundant fishes in high intertidal salt-marsh habitat. The Longjaw Mudsucker depends on high intertidal creeks in marshes dominated by pickleweed (Sarcocornia sp). The fish reside within burrows in soft sediments and is the only fish species that can remain in intertidal creeks during low tide when the creeks completely de-water. Longjaw Mudsucker have a wide tolerance range for salinity, up to 80-ppt and can be the only fish species to occupy industrial salt ponds in the San Francisco Estuary. In this study, UC Davis conducted minnow trap sampling in remnant pickleweed marshes and adjacent salt pond restorations to document the distribution, relative abundance, and condition (length-weight) of fish occupying these extant and restored habitats. During the pilot effort in late summer-fall of 2010 we conducted minnow trap sampling across a number of sites in the Alviso Marsh, Eden Landing Marsh, Ravenswood Marsh and Bair Island Marsh, sampling muted restoration ponds, tidal restoration ponds and remnant marsh habitats adjacent to restoration sites. From February 2011 to July 2012 we focused efforts in two tidal restoration ponds in the Alviso Marsh (A6 and A21) and one muted restoration pond in the Ravenswood Marsh (SF-2) on approximately monthly revisit schedule.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHobbs, James. 2024-05-29.

            "description": " EPA and its state and tribal partners conducted a survey of the nation's lakes, ponds and\n    reservoirs (>10 acres, using NHD) in 2007. This National Lakes Assessment was designed to\n    provide statistically valid regional and national estimates of the condition of lakes. It used a\n    probability-based sampling design (5 size classes of lakes, 9 agglomerated Omernik ecoregions,\n    and spatially distributed across the lower 48 US states) to represent the condition of all lakes\n    in similar regions sharing similar ecological characteristics. Consistent sampling and\n    analytical procedures ensured that the results could be compared across the country. The NLA\n    helped build state and tribal capacity for monitoring and assessment and promoted collaboration\n    across jurisdictional boundaries in the assessment of water quality. 1000 total lakes were\n    included in the NLA (909 lakes visited once and 91 that were revisited), however, the dbase also\n    includes additional lakes for any states that performed an \u2018intensification\u2019 in\n    order to do a state-wide lake assessment. Finally, there are lakes that are designated as\n    \u2018reference\u2019 lakes that were not chosen in the same probabilistic fashion, but were\n    chosen state-by-state using a variety of methods. For more info on the lakes and survey design\n    see:\n    http://water.epa.gov/type/lakes/upload/2006_05_05_lakes_lakessurvey_site_selection_factsheet.pdf\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nTarquinio, Ellen; Pollard, Amina. 2017-04-20.

            "description": " The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON; https://www.neonscience.org) collects water temperature measurements from its seven lake sites using a temperature chain consisting of thermistors measuring at various depths throughout the water column.  This data is published as part of the water temperature at specific depth in surface water data product (DP1.20264.001). During 2021, a misconfiguration resulted in gaps in this data. The multisonde used to measure water quality (DP1.20288.001) also collects water temperature measurements that can potentially be used to fill these gaps.  This data is not published by NEON as part of the Level 1 water quality data product because it is not as accurate as the temperature chain derived measurements.  The calibration of the multisonde temperature sensor is also factory set and cannot be adjusted. This data package contains the Level 0 multisonde water temperature data for NEON lake sites in 2021.  This is raw data that has not been QA/QC'ed.  NEON makes no guarantees about the accuracy of this data.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nHensley, Robert. 2022-01-24.

            "description": " Dataset contains occurrences of fish and invertebrates at nine oil and\n  gas platforms between 1995 and 2011 in the southern California (Pt.\n  Arguello to Long Beach). Observations were collected using a manned\n  submersible at depths ranging from 29 \u2013 224 meters (95 - 739 feet).\n  Data are organized into two tables: (1) the fish count (1995-2000) and\n  (2) the invertebrate count (1997-2011). Fish surveys were conducted primarily at nine Platforms (Irene,\n  Hidalgo, Harvest, Hermosa, Holly, Gilda, Grace, Gina, Gail) in the\n  Santa Barbara Channel and Santa Maria Basin. Invertebrate surveys were\n  collected at these nine platforms plus Platform Edith, located off\n  Long Beach (1998) and partial submersible surveys were completed\n  around Platforms C, B, A, Hillhouse, Henry, Houchin, Hogan, and\n  Habitat (2000). See additional methods under \u201cMethods\u201d and citations\n  therein. The Santa Barbara Channel and Santa Maria Basin are situated in a\n  dynamic marine transition zone between the regional flow patterns of\n  central and southern California. The Santa Barbara Channel is about\n  100 km long by about 50 km wide (60 x 20 miles) and is bordered on the\n  south by the Northern Channel Islands (San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa\n  Cruz, and Anacapa). The smaller Santa Maria Basin is located off Pt.\n  Arguello to the northwest. The entire area is bathed in a complex\n  hydrographic system of currents and water masses. The convergence of\n  different water masses in the Santa Barbara Channel results in\n  relatively large scale fluctuations in physical parameters (e.g.,\n  temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nutrient concentrations) and biotic\n  assemblages (e. g., flora and fauna).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nLove, Milton; Snook, Linda; Nishimoto, Mary M; Kui, Li. 2017-09-30.

A global analysis of the relationship\n  between cyanotoxins in water and fish. Frontiers in Marine Science.\n  doi: 10.3389/fmars.2018.00030 Cyanobacteria, the primary bloom-forming organisms in fresh water,\n  elicit a spectrum of problems in lentic systems. The most immediate\n  concern for people and animals are cyanobacterial toxins, which have\n  been detected at variable concentrations in water and fish around the\n  world. Cyanotoxins can transfer through food webs, potentially\n  increasing the risk of exposure to people who eat fish from affected\n  waters, yet little is known about how cyanotoxins fluctuate in wild\n  fish tissues. We collated existing studies on cyanotoxins in fish and\n  fresh water from lakes around the world into a global dataset to test\n  the hypothesis that cyanotoxin concentrations in fish increase with\n  water toxin concentrations. We limited our quantitative analysis to\n  microcystins because data on other cyanotoxins in fish were sparse,\n  but we provided a qualitative summary of other cyanotoxins reported in\n  wild, freshwater fish tissues. We found a positive relationship\n  between intracellular microcystin in water samples and microcystin in\n  fish tissues that had been analyzed by assay methods (enzyme-linked\n  immunosorbent assay and protein phosphatase inhibition assay). We\n  expected microcystin to be found in increasingly higher concentrations\n  from carnivorous to omnivorous to planktivorous fishes. We found,\n  however, that omnivores generally had the highest tissue microcystin\n  concentrations. Additionally, we found contrasting results for the\n  level of microcystin in different tissue types depending on the toxin\n  analysis method. Because microcystin and other cyanotoxins have the\n  potential to impact public health, our results underline the current\n  need for comprehensive and uniform detection methods for the analysis\n  of cyanotoxins in complex matrices.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nFlores, Natalie; Miller, Todd; Stockwell, Jason. 2018-02-07.

            "description": "Ecological models predict that the effects of mammalian herbivore exclusion on plant diversity depend on resource availability and plant exposure to ungulate grazing over evolutionary time. Using an experiment replicated in 57 grasslands on six continents, with contrasting evolutionary history of grazing, we tested how resources (mean annual precipitation and soil nutrients) determine herbivore exclusion effects on plant diversity, richness, and evenness. Here we show that at sites with a long history of ungulate grazing, herbivore exclusion reduced plant diversity by reducing both richness and evenness, and the responses of richness and diversity to herbivore exclusion decreased with mean annual precipitation. At short with a short history of grazing, the effects of herbivore exclusion were not related to precipitation but differed for native and exotic plant richness. Thus, plant species\u2019 evolutionary history of grazing continues to shape the response of the world\u2019s grasslands to changing mammalian herbivory.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nPrice, Jodi; Sitters, Judith; Ohlert, Timothy; Tognetti, Pedro; Brown, Cynthia; Seabloom, Eric; Borer, Elizabeth; Prober, Suzanne; Bakker, Elisabeth; MacDougall, Andrew; Yahdjian, Laura; Gruner, Daniel; Olde Venterink, Harry; Barrio, Isabel; Graff, Pamela; Bagchi, Sumanta; Alberto Arnillas, Carlos; Bakker, Jonathan; Blumenthal, Dana; Boughton, Elizabeth; Brudvig, Lars; Bugalho, Miguel; Cadotte, Marc; Caldeira, Maria; Dickman, Chris; Donohue, Ian; Gr\u00e9gory, Sonnier; Hautier, Yann; J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, Ingibj\u00f6rg; Lannes, Luciola; McCulley, Rebecca; Moore, Joslin; Power, Sally; Risch, Anita; Sch\u00fctz, Martin; Standish, Rachel; Stevens, Carly; Veen, Ciska; Virtanen, Risto; Wardle, Glenda. 2022-04-25.

Environmental variables include Mean Annual Temperature (MAT), Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Aridity Index (AI). For every plot the impact of herbivore exclusion is calculated as Log Response Ratios (LRR) for Inverse Simpson's diversity, plant richness (total, exotic and native), Simpson's evenness and also for light availability. Every site also has a proxy for grazing intensity, plant biomass in the fenced plots, and ambient soil nitrogen.",

            "description": " These data describe the spatial definitions of patches of giant kelp,\n  Macrocystis pyrifera, in central and southern California, USA, using a\n  27-year time series of giant kelp canopy biomass from Landsat 5\n  Thematic Mapper satellite imagery (1984-2011). Giant kelp patches were\n  delineated using a spatial synchrony-based method that avoids the\n  consolidation of adjacent, independently fluctuating local populations\n  into \"megapatches\". The method uses a network theory\n  modularity approach to optimally cluster Landsat pixels into patches\n  based on suitable habitat area (i.e., all areas containing giant kelp,\n  1984-2011) and the spatial synchrony of canopy biomass. These data\n  were described in Cavanaugh, K. C., D. A. Siegel, P. T. Raimondi, and\n  F. A. Alberto. 2014. Patch definition in metapopulation analysis: a\n  graph theory approach to solve the mega-patch problem.

            "description": " The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) is simultaneously a central hub of\n    water delivery in California and home to commercially important and\n    endangered fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, Green Sturgeon, and Delta\n    and Longfin Smelt. Extensive ecological monitoring has been\n    conducted for over 50 years, mainly under the auspices of the\n    Interagency Ecological Program for the San Francisco Estuary\n    (https://iep.ca.gov/). We integrated fish catch and length data from\n    10 long-term monitoring surveys in the SFE. The integrated database\n    contains survey-level data such as environmental variables and\n    sampling effort in addition to the fish-level species, lengths, and\n    counts. Zero catches have been filled in for any species not caught\n    in a sample. The geographic scope includes San Francisco Bay through\n    the upper estuary, and the timeseries spans 1959 to 2024. Sampling\n    methods, gear, fish length metric, and other factors differ among\n    the component surveys. Sampling designs (locations and temporal\n    frequency) have also changed over time. Thus, it is highly\n    recommended to inspect the documentation of the component surveys\n    for more information on their methods.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nBashevkin, Samuel; Nguyen, Trinh; Tham, Enoch; Gaeta, Jereme; Mitchell, Lara; Khanna, Shruti; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Stagg, Jacob; McKenzie, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Nanninga, Adam; Holcombe, Erika; Arrambide, Adriana; Huber, Eric; Marcetti, Donald; Steinhart, Geoffrey; United States Fish and Wildlife Service; Erly, Kate; Cook, Ryan; Speegle, Jonathan; Bigham, Gershom; Supervisory Fish Biologist, Denise, Goodman; Senegal, Taylor; Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Mora, Vanessa; Oceguera Zavala, Jennifer; Jimenez, Jessica; Interagency Ecological Program (IEP); Damon, Lauren; Chorazyczewski, Adam; Siddiqui, Samreen; Assen, Geir; Afentoulis, Virginia; Griffiths, Walter; Damon, Lauren; CDFW; Teejay, O'Rear; John, Durand; Peter, Moyle; CDFW; CDFW. 2024-08-02.

Biomass of the surface\n    canopy was estimated using diver-calibrated Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced\n    Thematic Mapper Plus satellite imagery. Fecundity was estimated from canopy biomass pixel data\n    using a seasonally-adjusted relationship between the diver-measured density of giant kelp\n    spore-bearing tissue and the Landsat estimate of canopy biomass density using data collected\n    across five years at the San Clemente Artificial Reef, located offshore of San Clemente,\n    California, USA. Landsat pixel-scale estimates of giant kelp biomass and fecundity were summed\n    across space for each giant kelp patch and averaged across time separately with two semesters\n    each year (January\u2013June and July\u2013December). The location and area of each giant kelp patch are\n    also provided. These data were described in <ulink url=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/15-0283.1\">Castorani, M.\n      C., D. C. Reed, F.

            "description": " In the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta, California spends millions of dollars each year to treat submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) such as Egeria densa and Myriophyllum spicatum. We integrated four different datasets to examine the efficacy of SAV treatment using fluridone over five years (2014-2018) across the entire ecosystem. For 132 sites across the Delta, we collated annual information on whether a site was treated, the amount of fluridone sprayed per site per unit area of SAV, consecutive years of treatment, and water speed within the site. This dataset was analyzed and the results of the analysis were published in a paper in Biological Invasions (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-023-03013-7).\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nKhanna, Shruti; Gaeta, Jereme. 2023-08-10.

            "description": " The LAGOS-US LIMNO data package is one of the core data modules of LAGOS-US, an\n        extensible research-ready platform designed to study the 479,950 lakes and reservoirs larger\n        than or equal to 1 ha in the conterminous US (48 states plus the District of Columbia). The\n        LIMNO module contains in situ observations of 47 parameters of lake physics, chemistry, and\n        biology (hereafter referred to as chemistry) from lake surface samples (defined as\n        observations taken from the epilimnion of a lake) obtained from the Water Quality Portal,\n        the National Lakes Assessment (2007, 2012, 2017), and NEON programs. LIMNO provides\n        3,511,020 observations across all parameters collected between 1975 and 2021 from 20,329\n        lakes; the number of observations per lake ranged from 1 to 20,605 with a median of 32. The\n        database design that supports the LAGOS-US research platform was created based on several\n        important design features: lakes are the fundamental unit of consideration, all lakes in the\n        spatial extent above the minimum size must be represented, and most information is connected\n        to individual lakes. The design is modular, interoperable (the modules can be used with each\n        other, as well as other comprehensive lake data products such as the USGS NHD), and\n        extensible (future database modules can be developed and used in the LAGOS-US research\n        platform by others). Users are encouraged to use the other two core data modules that are\n        part of the LAGOS-US platform: LOCUS (location, identifiers, and physical characteristics of\n        lakes and their watersheds) and GEO (characteristics defining geospatial and temporal\n        ecological setting quantified at multiple spatial divisions) that are each found in their\n        own data packages.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\nShuvo, Arnab; Lottig, Noah; Webster, Katherine; Delany, Austin; Reinl, Kait; Gries, Corinna; Smith, Nicole; Poisson, Autumn; McCullough, Ian; Collins, Sarah; King, Katelyn; Phillips, Ellie; Cheruvelil, Kendra; Soranno, Patricia. 2023-09-25.

Surface water microbe samples are collected at the same time and location as surface water cell count samples and surface water chemistry samples once per month in wadeable streams (12 times per year) and every-other month in lakes and rivers (6 times per year). Details on sampling locations and timing are provided in the NEON document titled Surface Water Chemistry Sampling in Aquatic Habitats (https://data.neonscience.org/documents). In wadeable streams, surface water microbe samples are collected near the downstream S2 sensor location. In lakes, microbial samples are collected near the the 'buoy', 'littoral 1', and 'littoral 2' sensors, and sampling depth(s) is dependent on lake stratification. In rivers, microbial samples are collected near the buoy sensor. Water samples are filtered on 0.22 um Sterivex capsule filters, capped and flash-frozen in the field. Sterivex filters are archived at the NEON Biorepository at -80 degrees Celsius. See related links below for protocol.\n\n**Citation Information:**\n\n2023-02-14.
