As such, many of the salmon monitoring and evaluation efforts in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay-Delta are hampered by uncertainty about population (stock) identification and proportional effects of management actions (Dekar et al. 2013; IEP 2019). Studies have identified that the current identification method (length-at-date models) of juvenile Chinook salmon (Fisher 1992) captured in the watershed vary in their accuracy, particularly for spring-run (NMFS 2013; Harvey et al. 2014; Merz et al. 2014). The inaccuracy of the size-based methods is likely due to differences in fish distribution during early rearing, habitat-specific growth rates, and inter-annual variability in temperatures and food availability that lead to overlap in size ranges among stocks. The primary objective of this project was the genetic classification (to race; Evolutionary Significant Unit) of Chinook Salmon captured from State Water Project and Central Valley Project fish protection facilities and Interagency Ecological Program monitoring programs. The population-of-origin was determined for sampled fish by comparing their genotypes to reference genetic baselines.  Genetic methods, having less statistical uncertainty that size-based models for population identification, were intended to directly target (and reduce) one source of uncertainty in the estimation of loss (take) from water diversions (operations) and develop the information necessary for understanding stock-specific distribution, habitat utilization, abundance, and life history variation.

Freshwater outflow actions during the fall season are hypothesized to improve Delta Smelt habitat and therefore Delta Smelt condition before the spawning life stage. As part of efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of such actions to benefit Delta Smelt populations, various studies were initiated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation under the Directed Outflow Project (DOP). One component of the DOP was to evaluate how the Fall X2 freshwater outflow action changed the lower trophic prey available to Delta Smelt. The action is hypothesized to change abiotic and biotic aspects that can benefit Delta Smelt habitat by using freshwater outflow to maintain the position of X2 (defined as the distance in kilometers from the Golden Gate Bridge to the tidally averaged 2 ppt salinity isohaline) at around 70 km during wet or above normal precipitation water years. This moves the low salinity zone (0.5 - 6 ppt) further seaward into Suisun Bay which increases the area of preferred Delta Smelt habitat. Field sampling began the September of 2017 and occurred bi-weekly through the end of November, paired with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program. Three random sites were sampled per target region (Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, the Lower Sacramento River, the Cache Slough Complex, and the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel) per week. Sites were chosen using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified design. During 2018, sampling was increased to weekly and in 2019-2020 sampling began in April and ended in November. Sampling occurs for three different habitat types: shoal, channel surface and channel deep at each site depending on the depth of the water column. The shoal habitat is less than 10 feet, channel habitat is greater than 10 feet and channel deep habitat is greater than 20 feet. Plankton nets are towed approximately 0.5-meters below the surface in shoal and channel habitats and targeting the lower half to lower third of the water column in channel deep habitats. Two size classes of zooplankton are targeted using a pair of nets with different mesh sizes: mesozooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with a 150 micrometer mesh net and macrozooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with a 500 micrometer mesh net. Before each zooplankton tow water quality variables (temperature, dissolve oxygen, turbidity, specific conductivity, salinity, pH, and chlorophyll-a) are measured using a YSI EXO 2 sonde, 1 meter below the surface for channel surface and shoal habitats or at the target tow depth for channel deep habitats. Alongside zooplankton tows, phytoplankton samples are taken from a water sample and preserved in a Lugol's solution. In addition, whole water samples are filtered for nutrient (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and dissolved organic carbon) and chlorophyll-a analysis. These samples are only taken at the channel surface and shoal habitats.

The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. YBFMP’s data is often accompanied by information on whether the Yolo Bypass is inundated, as water quality, and species composition and abundance can be greatly altered during inundation. This dataset was created to consistently estimate inundation over time. Estimating inundation in the Yolo Bypass is usually done by referencing stage height in the Sacramento River at Fremont Weir.

The objectives of the EMP are to obtain consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring stations and to report this information for the purpose of management and conservation of the upper San Francisco Estuary.

The main objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to collect baseline data on lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and insect drift), juvenile and adult fish, hydrology, and water quality parameters. As the Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service biological opinions for Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and winter and spring-run Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and by California EcoRestore, these baseline data are critical for evaluating success of future restoration projects. In addition, the data have already served to increase our understanding of the role of the Yolo Bypass in the life history of native fishes, and its ecological function in the San Francisco Estuary. Aquatic and terrestrial insects are an important component in the diet of juvenile and adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including two important native fishes: juvenile Chinook Salmon and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects drift invertebrates year-round from two sites. Since 2011, samples have been collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using a rectangular aquatic drift net that sits at the surface of the water. Invertebrates are identified and enumerated by contractors (currently EcoAnalysts, Inc.). The goals of the monitoring program are to compare the seasonal variations in densities and species trends of aquatic and terrestrial insects/non-insects within (1) Sacramento River channel, and (2) the Yolo Bypass, the river’s seasonal floodplain. Key findings to date: (1) Chinook Salmon sampled in the floodplain had diets comprised of 90% Dipterans and zooplankton, with Chironomidae being the dominant Diptera family (Sommer et al., 2001), (2)The floodplain of the Yolo Bypass contains significantly higher densities of Diptera (Diptera densities being positively associated with flow) and terrestrial invertebrates than the adjacent Sacramento River (Sommer et al. 2001b: Sommer et al. 2004: Sommer et al. 2007), (3) A major portion of the diet of juvenile Sacramento Splittail are chironomid larvae (Kurth and Nobriga 2001, Moyle et al. 2004, Sommer et al. 2007), and (4) The Yolo Bypass was the site of the recent discovery of a new aestivating and winter emerging chironomid; Hydrobaenus saetheri (Cranston et al. 2007).", "issued": "2021-04-22", "modified": "[modified]", "accessLevel": "private", "identifier": "", "landingPage": "https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.818.3", "license": "[license]", "spatial": "[spatial]", "temporal": "1998-02-03 / 2019-12-27", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "[organization]"}, "accrualPeriodicity": "Collection is Ongoing; updates expected approximately annually", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Interagency Ecological Program; Pien, Catarina; Adams, Jesse; Schreier, Brian M", "hasEmail": "Catarina.Pien@water.ca.gov; Jesse.Adams@water.ca.gov; Nicole.Kwan@water.ca.gov"}, "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "column", "format": "column", "title": "Drift Invertebrate Taxonomy", "description": "Drift invertebrate taxonomic tree", "downloadURL": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/data/eml/edi/818/3/793364a600f9725af3f6b4ef333a79f3"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "column", "format": "column", "title": "Drift InvertebrateData", "description": "Drift invertebrate catch and water quality from the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program", "downloadURL": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/data/eml/edi/818/3/650b404590fa51895c9d052bca7a5a90"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "column", "format": "column", "title": "Stations", "description": "Drift invertebrate sampling station locations", "downloadURL": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/data/eml/edi/818/3/89146f1382d7dfa3bbf3e4b1554eb5cc"}], "keywords": ["aquatic ecosystems", "aquatic invertebrates", "California Department of Water Resources", "communities", "crustaceans", "ecology", "electrical conductivity", "estuaries", "floodplain", "food webs", "freshwater", "Interagency Ecological Program", "long term", "lower trophic monitoring", "macroinvertebrates", "ph", "rivers", "Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta", "san francisco estuary", "seasonality", "surveys", "turbidity", "water quality", "water temperature", "weather", "Yolo Bypass", "Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program"], "theme": ["Water"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "title": "Interagency Ecological Program: Fish catch and water quality data from the Sacramento River floodplain and tidal slough, collected by the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program, 1998-2023.", "description": "Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP), California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a fish monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain and tidal slough, since 1998.

Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 2. Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with stakeholders and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management-related questions. 3. Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods.      The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are presented in this dataset. The rotary screw trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine species abundance and life stage of juvenile outmigrants and resident small-bodied fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, and (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns.      The fyke trap sampling objectives are to: (1) examine abundance of migrating and resident adult fishes, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns in fish abundance and species composition, especially with regard to anadromous species, (3) examine the effect of physical and environmental conditions on these patterns, and (4) provide data on the timing and duration of species captured in the Yolo Bypass for comparison to those captured in other Sacramento Valley tributaries. The beach seine surveys are conducted in the Yolo Bypass’s perennial channel (Toe Drain), inundated floodplain, disconnected inundated ponds, and perennial ponds. The objectives of Toe Drain and inundated floodplain beach seine sampling are: (1) to examine species abundance and composition in different water year types and inundation conditions, (2) to spatially compare fish abundance and diversity in the Yolo Bypass, and (3) to estimate growth rates and densities of salmon in the Yolo Bypass versus the Sacramento River. The objectives for beach seine sampling in disconnected inundated ponds are: (1) measure the diversity and abundance of fish species stranded in ponds located in different regions and habitats, (2) to compare relative densities of fish before and after floodplain drainage, (3) to examine the sources of fish mortality in ponds including temperature, desiccation and predation, (4) to develop long-term annual Yolo Bypass stranding indices for reference locations, and (5) to examine relationships between annual stranding indices and physical variables such as hydrology and temperature. The objectives for seine sampling in the perennial ponds are: (1) to examine seasonal fish species abundance and diversity in the Yolo Bypass versus the Sacramento River and (2) to examine species abundance and composition in different water year types.      The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts.

These objectives are met by establishing standards mandated in water right permits issued to the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation by the SWRCB. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels.                  In 1971, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This Decision contained new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. D-1379 was also the first water right decision to provide terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to routinely determine water quality conditions and changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. The monitoring program described in D-1379 was developed by the Stanford Research Institute through a contract with the SWRCB. Implementation of the monitoring program began in 1972, as SWRCB, DWR, and USBR met to define their individual responsibilities for various elements of the monitoring program. In 1978, amendments to water quality standards were implemented and resulted in Water Right Decision 1485 (D-1485). More recently these standards were again amended under the 1995 Water Quality Control Plan and Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) established in 1999. The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements described in D-1641. D-1641 requires DWR and USBR to conduct a comprehensive environmental monitoring program to determine compliance with the water quality standards and also to submit an annual report to SWRCB discussing data collected.                  The phytoplankton monitoring program is one element of DWR’s and USBR’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton, and benthic organisms. The overall objective of the phytoplankton monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in phytoplankton diversity, abundance, and distribution associated with physical and other biological factors in the estuary.

Conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) since 1959, STN has sampled fixed locations from Eastern San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista on the Sacramento River, and to Stockton on the San Joaquin River; and a single station in the lower Napa River. The study area was expanded in 2011 to include the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (SDWSC) and Cache Slough (CS). Currently, 40 stations are sampled as a “survey” every other week June through August for 6 surveys. A conical net, lashed to a fixed metal “D” frame, is pulled obliquely through the water column 2 to 3 times at each station. All fish and macro-invertebrates are identified and enumerated from each tow, with fork lengths (mm) of the first 50 of each fish species also recorded. Fish catch, length-frequency, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) among stations is available with data visualization tools on the study website for all species (https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey).  Data collected at historic 31 stations are used to calculate annual relative abundance indices for age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). The remaining 9 stations are sampled to expand our sampling range further upriver and increase our understanding of larval and juvenile fish abundance and distribution in the lower Napa River and the North Delta. A meso-zooplankton net targeting copepods and cladocerans is also used in parallel to assess fish food resources at each station and a subset of the fish collected are retained for diet analysis by CDFW researchers (beginning 2005, see STN and FMWT zooplankton data on EDI). The STN also measures habitat conditions via water temperature (°C), water clarity (Secchi disk depth in cm), Turbidity (NTU) and specific conductance (µs/cm). Historically, STN began in response to the development of Central Valley Project pumping plants exporting water from the South Delta.

It is a central hub of water delivery in    California and home to a number of commercially important and    endangered fish, such as Chinook Salmon, Green Sturgeon, and Delta    Smelt. To monitor the environmental impacts of water exports from    this system, extensive ecological monitoring has been conducted    since the 1960s. To track lower trophic levels, zooplankton    abundance has been monitored from 1972 to present. Starting with    just one survey (the CA Department of Water Resources’ [CDWR] and    California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s [CDFW] Environmental    Monitoring Program) in 1972, the suite of zooplankton surveys    gradually expanded with time. Several surveys traditionally focused    on monitoring fish abundance added zooplankton nets to their    sampling programs. The CDFW 20-mm larval fish survey added    zooplankton sampling in 1995, the CDWR Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring    Program add zooplankton in 1999, the CDFW Summer Townet Survey added    zooplankton in 2005, and the Fall Midwater Trawl added zooplankton    in 2007. Two new sampling programs, the Fish Restoration Program and    Directed Outflow Project, began in 2015 and 2017, respectively. All    sampling programs continue today. Each survey samples once or twice    monthly at set of fixed or random stations that varies across    surveys depending on their objectives. While the Environmental    Monitoring Program samples year-round, the other surveys are mostly    seasonal, although additional months were sampled in some years.    Most surveys target open channels although the Fish Restoration    Program samples in or near shallow tidal wetlands. Three size    classes of zooplankton are targeted by these sampling programs with    different net mesh sizes: micro zooplankton (copepods and rotifers)    are targeted with a 43 µm mesh net, meso zooplankton (copepods and    cladocerans) are targeted with 150 - 160 µm mesh nets, and macro    zooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with 500-505 µm mesh    nets. We have integrated data from all 7 surveys and 3 size classes    into a powerful long-term record of zooplankton in the San Francisco    Estuary, representing over 80,000 zooplankton samples and over 2    billion estimated zooplankton captured by the nets in these surveys.    Over the duration of this zooplankton dataset, the zooplankton    community species composition has almost completely turned over    after a series of species invasions from East Asia, numerous drought    cycles have come and gone, and important fish species have    dramatically declined during the Pelagic Organism Decline in 2002,    likely due in part to reduced food supply from zooplankton. Data    from the individual surveys have been used in prior studies to    investigate issues related to species invasions, flows, fish diets    and population dynamics, zooplankton population dynamics, and    community ecology. Our integrated dataset offers new and    unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution to address these and other    questions with greater statistical power.", "issued": "2023-03-09", "modified": "[modified]", "accessLevel": "private", "identifier": "", "landingPage": "https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.539.4", "license": "[license]", "spatial": "[spatial]", "temporal": "1972-01-10 / 2021-12-16", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "[organization]"}, "accrualPeriodicity": "Ongoing", "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Bashevkin, Samuel M; Hartman, Rosemary; Thomas, Madison; Barros, Arthur; Burdi, Christina E; Hennessy, April; Tempel, Trishelle; Kayfetz, Karen; Alstad, Karrin; Pien, Catarina", "hasEmail": "sam.bashevkin@deltacouncil.ca.gov"}, "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "column", "format": "column", "title": "biomass_mesomicro.csv", "description": "Average carbon mass of zooplankton species and life stages                              obtained from the literature.

The main objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to collect baseline data on lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and insect drift), juvenile and adult fish, hydrology, and water quality parameters. As the Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by numerous regulatory agencies, these baseline data are critical for evaluating success of future restoration projects. In addition, the data have already served to increase our understanding of the role of the Yolo Bypass in the life history of native fishes, and its ecological function in the San Francisco Estuary. Zooplankton are an important component in the diet of larval, juvenile, and small adult fishes within the San Francisco Estuary, including Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, Striped Bass, and Sacramento Splittail. The YBFMP collects zooplankton year-round from two sites. Since 2011, samples have been collected biweekly (every other week) to weekly (during floodplain inundation) using 150- and 50- micrometer mesh plankton nets.

We used multivariate autoregressive state space (MARSS) models to quantify environmental (abiotic) and biotic controls on phytoplankton and mesozooplankton biomass. The importance of specific abiotic drivers (e.g. water temperature, turbidity, nutrients) and trophic interactions differed significantly among hydrodynamic exchange zones with different mean residence times. Abiotic drivers explained more variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics than a model including only trophic interactions, but individual phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions explained more variation than individual abiotic drivers. Interactions between zooplankton and phytoplankton were strongest in landward reaches with the longest residence times and the highest zooplankton biomass. Interactions between cryptophytes and both copepods and cladocerans were stronger than interactions between bacillariophytes (diatoms) and zooplankton taxa, despite contributing less biovolume in all but the most landward reaches.
